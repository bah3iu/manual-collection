"On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Supra-Renal Capsules","","1855","&lt;p&gt;“After receiving a medical degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1815, Addison (1793-1860) joined the staff of Guy’s Hospital in London, where he was Richard Bright&#39;s colleagues as physician and lecturer on medicine. He was a man of masterful but cold and haughty personality, more interested in the diagnosis of disease than the treatment of his patients. It was even said that ‘he sometimes forgot to prescribe!’ Understandably, his practice never became large, and he was able to spend most of his time in teaching and in pathologic research. He had many medical interests. For example, he was the co-author of the first English book on poisons, he first described xanthoma, and he was a pioneer the use of static electricity in the treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Addison and Bright collaborated in writing an elementary textbook on medical practice but did not complete it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Addison is best known for his brilliant clinical accounts of pernicious anemia and Addison&#39;s disease. He first defined the syndrome of pernicious anemia to the south London Medical Society in 1849, although no formal report was printed. Later in the same year, he contributed a paper to the &lt;i&gt;London Medical Gazette&lt;/i&gt; in which he described cases of pernicious anemia (until recently called ‘Addisonian pernicious anemia’). In the same paper, he presented three cases of weakness and pigmentation in which postmortem examination revealed destruction of the adrenal glands. He revised and expanded this paper and published a new version as a slim monograph, &lt;i&gt;Disease of the Supra-Renal Capsules&lt;/i&gt;, six Years later when he was sixty years old. At that time, Addison’s account of the condition he called ‘melasma suprarenale’ was regarded as a scientific curiosity, but its importance to medical practice was soon realized, and his discussion of the ‘suprarenal syndrome’ became a foundation stone of modern endocrinology. Trousseau, his famous contemporary and a generous interpreter of other men&#39;s ideas, gave the syndrome the name ‘Addison’s disease.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This notable book is based on a series of detailed histories of eleven cases and is illustrated with accurate but rather coarsely drawn full-page colored plates” (Waife et al. 207).&lt;/p&gt;","addison&#39;s disease; adrenal glands","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Bone-Graft Surgery","","1915","&lt;p&gt;“Fred Albee (1876-1945), professor of orthopedic surgery at the New York Postgraduate Medical School, was a pioneer in introducing living bone-graft surgery. As a boy, he had helped his grandfather graft fruit trees; from him Albee acquired a knowledge of the remarkable restorative capacity of a graft as well as the talent for exactitude and precision that characterized the brilliant work of his professional career. Another boyhood fascination was machinery, especially sawmills. At the age of nine, he improvised a water-driven rotary saw that was not refined enough to cut wood but did an excellent job on rutabagas. Eventually, this ingenious device formed the basis for the electrically powered Albee bone mill, which permitted rapid and accurate bone cuts under sterile conditions in the operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Albee’s bone-grafting technique was a striking improvement over the earlier methods for stabilizing fractures and encouraging osteosynthesis that had been introduced by Sir William Arbuthnot Lane in London between 1894 and 1907. Albee’s work was developed on a large scale in the United States, Austria, and England only after World War I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His clinical achievement was founded on extensive experiments on animals (chiefly dogs and sheep) and careful study of his predecessors’ work and records.

"Orthopedié ou l&#39;Art de prévenir et de corriger . . .","","1741","&lt;p&gt;“Nicolas Andry de Boisregard (1658-1742) was a professor of medicine at the University of Paris. At the age of eighty-three, he published an account of his experience in ‘the art of preventing and correcting deformities of the body in children,’ for which he coined the name &lt;i&gt;‘L’Orthropedie.’&lt;/i&gt; ‘I have formed it,’ he wrote, ‘of two words, namely &lt;i&gt;orthos&lt;/i&gt; (straight) and &lt;i&gt;paidos&lt;/i&gt; (child).’ Although he did not actually found the specialty of orthopedics (fractures were being treated by surgeons), he developed the concept of prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of his book, he stressed the importance of moderate exercise in the cure of deformities. On the whole, he treated deformities by improving posture and employing mechanical aids and sensible clothing. Children in Andry’s day, especially those of the upper classes, were dressed in clothes that were extremely ill-suited for play. Tight waists and close-fitting breeches, corsets, and layers of petticoats made little boys and girls a pleasing spectacle in the drawing room but were thoroughly uncomfortable and severely limited the range of motion in their joints. Despite Andry’s commonsense writing on the undesirable effects of such garments, physicians generally did not endorse his criticisms until near the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work on orthopedics is divided into four sections dealing, in turn, with a general anatomic survey of the exterior of the body; the prevention and correction of deformities, particularly by means of proper carriage of the body; the treatment of deformities in the extremities, head, and face, including the gums and teeth; and the treatment of mutism and voice defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A man before his time, Andry had also postulated in 1701 that air, water, fermenting wine, vinegar, cider, beer, and milk contained microorganisms. He went on to suggest that such organisms might also be found within the lesions of smallpox and other diseased tissues and that mercury’s ability to kill them had enabled this element to cure syphilis. The idea was not well received by his medical colleagues and, in fact, became the subject of ridicule. His first descriptions of trigeminal neuralgia, however, were accepted from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Andry’s work made a great impact, because no comparable text had been written. An English translation was published promptly, in 1743. Sadly, Andry’s many new approaches were not universally applied for nearly one hundred years, although surgeons did much good work in the meantime on a few deformities, such as clubfoot and diseases of the spine and joints” (Waife et al. 113).&lt;/p&gt;","observation; posture; pediatrics","Paris, France","","","","compound_object","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De Lactibus Sive Lacteis Venis","","1627","&lt;p&gt;“Aselli (1581-1626), who had been a pupil of Fallopius, practiced as a surgeon in Milan. There he continued his anatomic research and wrote in a more dynamic manner and with greater physiologic insight than had whose predecessors, whose approach had been essentially teleologic and descriptive. Although Aselli’s notebooks and jottings for lectures have never been published, he is renowned for this small volume, which was published two years after his death at the age of forty-five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book records his chance discovery of the lacteal vessels in 1622 while he was displaying the mesenteric nerves the dog at an anatomic demonstration. In this fed animal, he noted a network of mesenteric vessels that contained a whitish fluid. Because such engorgement was absent and a fasting animal, he concluded that it was related to recent feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Writing before the publication of Harvey&#39;s work on the circulation, Aselli maintained that the liver was the center of the venous system and believed, as did Galen, that the intestinal veins carried chyle to the liver. Harvey knew that the Galenic account was wrong and remained skeptical about the existence of lacteals; The contradiction was cleared away when Jean Pecquet announced his discovery of the thoracic duct in 1651.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In his text, which comprises thirty-five chapters, Aselli took up the intestines in general, their veins, arteries, nerves, and a &#39;fourth, new kind&#39; of vessels. He explained why he had named the vessels he discovered &#39;lacteal,&#39; or milky, vessels and asked Why they had remained undiscovered for so long. He presented their anatomy in great detail and wondered whether they were supplied with chyle or blood. He also described the transit of chyle to the liver and discussed the contribution of the new vessels to the formation of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book was illustrated with a copper plate portrait of the author at the age of forty-two, when he made his discovery, and with four large foldout plates showing the lacteals and animal dissections. These are most remarkable woodcuts, both for their display of the dissections and for the method in which they were produced” (Waife et al. 61).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, regional; digestion; chyle; intestines; lymph; lymphatic system; ","Milan, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

" Inventum novum ex percussione thoracis humani ut signo abstrusos interni pectoris morbos detegendi","","1761","&lt;p&gt;“Auenbrugger (1722-1809) used his ‘New Discovery of Detecting from Percussion of the Human Chest Obscure Diseases within the Breast’ while he was physician to the Spanish Hospital in Vienna. He had carefully verified his findings by dissection before committing them to paper. The book begins with general chapters on chest diseases, then describes the special uses of his method, and includes fourteen case histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Auenbrugger was gifted with a musical ear and distinguished the ‘drum’ sound emitted by the healthy chest from the higher ‘tympanitic’ sound, or the dull ‘flesh’ sound of a disease chest. By tapping over fluids which had been injected into the chests of cadavers, he established the percussion note characteristic of pleural effusion. Applying the technique in his practice, he was able to prove his diagnosis by thoracentesis. Although he gave notice ‘to all doctors’ that percussion ‘deserves first place after examining the pulse and respiration,’ his method was not adopted by van Swieten—the leading Viennese physician—his former teacher, nor by de Haen, physician to the Vienna Clinic. De Haen’s successor, Maximilian Stoll, took it up but died prematurely, and the procedure was dropped. Auenbrugger Had also expressed the wish that his method might prove ‘a solace of the wretched and an increase of their art for true cultivators of medicine.’ The book was translated into French in 1770, but the translation also was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although not widely followed, the new method of percussion was taught in several German University Medical schools and was adopted by some prominent physicians. Corvisart, Napoleon’s physician, learned of it from Stoll’s writings and mentioned his own success with it and his book; He followed this by editing Auenbrugger’s original text in a new French translation (1808). Nearly fifty years after Auenbrugger’s publication, Corvisart’s advocacy firmly established percussion as a necessary procedure for every physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Auenbrugger retired from his hospital in 1762, had a distinguished career in private practice, and was ennobled in 1784 for his medical achievement. In 1783, he published a psychologic study of the urge to commit suicide, citing this urge as a real disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a distinguished member of the Viennese court, Auenbrugger delighted Empress Maria Theresa by writing a libretto for Salieri’s operetta, &lt;i&gt;The Chimney Sweep&lt;/i&gt;. Unassuming and sedate, he did not appear concerned that his new method of diagnosis remained almost unnoticed until a year before his death” (Waife et al. 127).&lt;/p&gt;","diagnosis; heart diseases; lung diseases; percussion; pulmonary heart disease; pulmonary medicine","Vienna, Austria","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Libri quinque Canonis Medicinae","","1593","&lt;p&gt;“Avicenna (980-1037), Persian by birth and Mohammedan by religion, was a child prodigy who had memorized the Koran by the age of ten. Avid for knowledge, he became well versed in mathematics, jurisprudence, philosophy, and poetry. In fact, several quatrains ascribed to Omar Khayyam are believed to have been written more than a century earlier by Avicenna. At sixteen, he took up the study of medicine and, by eighteen, had already gained renown as a physician. He became court physician and vizier to several caliphs in the Persian city of Isfahan and was chief physician to the great hospital at Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Avicenna’s most influential work was the ‘Canon of Medicine,’ written in Arabic, in which he summarized the experience of the Greco-Roman physicians Hippocrates and Galen and added many personal observations. Avicenna realized that certain illnesses, such as tuberculosis and dysentery, are communicable. Of the latter he wrote, ‘disease is transmitted from person to person.... The traveler is more exposed to illness from the diversity of the drinking water than he is from the diversity of foods. Hence it is necessary to be particular about correcting the bad qualities of the drinking water, and expend every effort in purifying it. Boil the water, for as we have already pointed out, boiling sometimes clarifies the water and separates off the impurities which are mixed with the intrinsic substance of the water.’ Avicenna also recognized the genetic nature of certain conditions, stating, ‘Hereditary transmission includes premature baldness and gout.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This massive and encyclopedic book of almost a million words was used throughout the Arabic-speaking world until relatively modern times. No author, after Galen, enjoyed so wide and durable a reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘Canon’ was translated into Latin for European physicians and reprinted many times in that language from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century. Only during the Renaissance, when Western physicians gained direct access to the medical writings of the ancient Greeks, did the ‘Canon’ begin to decline in influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The magnificent two-volume ‘Canon’ in the Lilly collection is in the original Arabic (although a Latin title page has been added) and includes some of Avicenna’s other scientific writings” (Waife et al. 53).&lt;/p&gt;","encyclopedia; metaphysics; philosophy, medical; traditional medicine","Rome, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Arabic","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De ovi mammalium et hominis genesi : epistolam ad Academiam Imperialem Scientiarum Petropolitanam","","1827","&lt;p&gt;“Born in Estonia of German parents, von Baer (1792-1876) spent the first half of his long life in Germany and the second half in Russia. His work was a link between the ‘nature philosophy’ of the eighteenth century and the precise inductive science of the nineteenth. This many-sided biologist was trained in botany and zoology as well as medicine. From 1819 to 1834, he taught at Konigsberg in East Prussia, where he made his original influential discoveries. He is best known for having found the mammalian ovum, which he detected in 1826 in the ovary of a dog and later in other mammals. He published this brief account of the formation of the egg of animals and man the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book describes the beginnings of the fetus in the dog, the genesis of the ovum, the Graafian vesicles, and the embryonic development of mammals. His announcement that ‘every animal which springs from coition of male and female is developed from an ovum, not from a simple generative fluid,’ cleared away many theoretical contrary opinions. The results of his infinite meticulousness in refining the then rudimentary techniques of microscopy laid the foundations for the new field of Embryology and earned the profound admiration of his contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Von Baer continued his observations and elaborated his ‘reflections’ in the larger, unfinished two-volume work, &lt;i&gt;Über die Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere&lt;/i&gt; (1828 and 1837). This title literally meant ‘the history and development of animals’ but soon acquired the technical connotation of ‘embryology.’ He first distinguished the germ layers and discovered the notochord (chorda dorsalis), transient structures of great importance in understanding embryonic development and the common genesis of vertebrates. Von Baer recognized the neural folds as rudiments of the nervous system and described the primary brain vesicles. He showed that all vertebrate embryos are more alike than their adult forms, since development proceeds from the general to the special, and thus discredited the widely held theory that all characteristics of the organism were ‘preformed’ in the ovum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Von Baer’s work provided a basis for systematic embryology. He was critical of Darwin’s theory of evolution, but his ideas had considerable influence on the contributions of embryologists to evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The last thirty years of his life were spent in Russia, where he devoted himself to studying the anthropology and physical geography of that country” (Waife et al. 181).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy; embryo, mammalian; embryology; embryonic structures","Leipzig, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

It was perhaps the first example of the modern concept of pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast to previous authors who had recorded organic lesions underlying the outward evidences of diseases, Baillie (1761-1823) classified such lesions according to types—softenings, hardenings, thickenings, ulcers, tumors, aneurysms, and so on. He confined his surgery to the thoracic and abdominal organs and the brain and wrote unusually well about diseases of the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. Baillie kept to objective description and avoided hypothetical correlations, although clinical symptoms were added in his second edition. He noticed that organic lesions may occur without clinical symptoms and that apparently similar symptoms may represent different lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Baillie combined his own observations with those of his two distinguished uncles, William and John Hunter. He was educated for the ministry but later turned to medicine. He inherited William Hunter’s famous anatomy school and museum in London in 1783 and directed the school for nearly twenty years. In 1787, he was appointed physician to St. Geroge’s Hospital, where John Hunter was one of the senior surgeons. Baillie became responsible for his uncle’s very remarkable biomedical museum after John Hunter’s death in 1793.

"Morbid Anatomy","","1793","&lt;p&gt;“Matthew Baillie’s &lt;i&gt;Morbid Anatomy,&lt;/i&gt; published when he was thirty-two, offered a new approach to the understanding of disease by systematically describing the morbid appearance of each organ at autopsy and correlating these findings with a full case history.

"The Antidiabetic Functions of the Pancreas and the Successful Isolation of the Antidiabetic Hormone—Insulin","","1923","&lt;p&gt;“Banting and Best’s discovery in 1922 of insulin, the antidiabetic pancreatic hormone, was the dramatic climax to a long search. Frederick Grant Banting (1891-1941) conceived an idea for achieving pancreatic control of diabetes almost by chance while working at London, Ontario, in 1920. J. J. R. Macleod (1876-1935), professor of physiology at the University of Toronto, an authority on carbohydrate metabolism, thought the problem intractable, because he knew of the unsuccessful research of workers in previous decades. Nevertheless, in May, 1921, he gave Banting financial support and laboratory space at the university and appointed Charles H. Best, a graduate student, to assist him. By August, they had produced a pancreatic extract that controlled the diabetes of a depancreatized dog; by January, 1922, they had made a crude extract from beef pancreas, and clinical trials had begun in human subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Macleod called in J. B. Collip, who contributed his biochemical expertise to purifying the new extract, Production of insulin in quantities suitable for clinical use was begun by American scientists in the laboratories of Eli Lilly and Company, and the practical treatment of diabetes was at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first report on insulin research appeared in an article by Banting and Best in the February, 1922, issue of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, and other journal articles followed. In January, 1923, Macleod and Banting recounted the history of the discovery in the Beaumont lectures given before the Wayne County Medical Society in Detroit, and these were published as a small book the next year. The first, delivered by Professor Macleod, was a historical review. It traced the development of knowledge about the pancreas from 1682 to the current time. The second lecture, also by Macleod, reviewed the Toronto laboratory experiments that led to the trial of insulin in man. The third and final lecture was given by Dr. Banting. After detailing aspects of the animal studies, he reported on the first clinical use of insulin in diabetic patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Banting and Macleod were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1923. Banting shared his portion of the prize with Dr. Best, and Macleod divided his with Collip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Lilly Library at Indiana University contains an outstanding collection assembled by J. K. Lilly, Jr., of early papers concerning this successful research” (Waife et al. 267).&lt;/p&gt;","insulin; observation; therapeutics","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Opthalmodouleia. Das ist, Augendienst . . .","","1583","&lt;p&gt;“Georg Bartisch (1535-1606), of Königsbrück, who describes himself on his book’s extraordinarily verbose title page as ‘Citizen, Oculist, Cutter, and Surgeon in the Ancient Ducal Town of Dresden,’ published the most comprehensive treatise that had yet been compiled on the care of the eyes. It was profusely illustrated with large woodcuts made from the writer’s own colored drawings. In his role of ‘cutter,’ Bartisch wrote a similar treatise on lithotomy, which did not appear in print until modern times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His work resembles that of other German surgeons, such as Hieronymus Brunschwig or Caspar Stromayr, whose ‘Copious Practice in the Treatment of Hernia’ had been issued in 1559. Each was a complete picture book of practical methods of treatment. The pictures were drawn from life and crowded with detail; they represent individual cases, in contrast to the generalized prototypes that appear in contemporary French and Italian books. Where modern artist would depict only the particular part of the body subject to the operation, Bartisch displays a whole face, the full-length figure of the patient, or a group seen with the Sergeant and his assistant in attendance. Some of these portraits are repeated with slight variations to depict different conditions of the eyes. A few anatomic plates with hinged overlays show successive depths of dissection. Vesalius Had introduced this method in 1543, although it was not much exploited until the seventeenth century. Bartisch also pictures instruments and masks for treating strabismus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This oversize book is divided into sixteen sections that cover anatomy, defects and diseases of the eyes and sight (especially strabismus, cataract, running or pustulent conditions, and corneal damage), the eyelids and eyelashes, external injuries, pain in the eyes, and injuries caused by witches or the devil. In each case, the surgical or medical treatment is clearly explained. Bartisch concluded with sections on the care necessary to maintain health of the eyes, the effects of venesection and diet, methods of preparing the necessary medicines and ointments, a survey of instruments, and forms of religious thanksgiving for cure. In addition to its remarkable range, the book is notable for recording in detail the bold and dangerous operations undertaken by sixteenth-century surgeons” (Waife et al. 49).&lt;/p&gt;","ophthalmologic surgical procedures; pathology; strabismus","Dresden, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice, and the Physiology of Digestion","","1833","&lt;p&gt;“Beaumont (1785-1853), a United States Army surgeon stationed at isolated Fort Mackinac in northern Michigan in 1822, was summoned to treat a French-Canadian &lt;i&gt;voyageur&lt;/i&gt;, Alexis St. Martin, for a wound in the abdomen from an accidental musket shot at close range. A permanent gastric fistula formed in the wound, and Beaumont realized that St. Martin’s case offered a unique opportunity to investigate the process of digestion. He was able to view the contents of the stomach during digestion through the opening and to watch the action of gastric secretions. He began his observations in the spring of 1825 and initially reported them in the &lt;i&gt;Medical Recorder&lt;/i&gt; of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the next eight years, although St. Martin was often away hunting and fur trapping, sometimes deep in the Canadian wilds, and Beaumont was reassigned to remote posts in the Wisconsin wilderness, he was able from time to time to find St. Martin and continue his experiments. At one point, he persuaded his patient to travel to Plattsburgh, New York, where Beaumont was spending a leave, for a series of tests. Specimens of St. Martin’s gastric juice were sent for analysis to chemists as the University of Virginia and at Yale University. Both found free hydrochloric acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The papers of 1825-1826 excited considerable interest, not the least in Europe, where Müller, Schwann, and Purkinje were influenced by the first report of Beaumont’s discovery. His book describing his studies in detail was printed in Plattsburgh in 1833. It was reprinted in Boston and translated into German the next year and was published again in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1838.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beaumont realized the value of his observations for gastric function, digestion, and the pathology of gastritis and suggested that there was some special secretion in the stomach in addition to the hydrochloric acid. This was confirmed in 1836, when Schwann discovered pepsin. Beaumont eventually lost touch with St. Martin, who is said to have survived some forty-five more years and to have fathered twenty children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This book, a remarkable example of brilliant clinical investigation performed under almost primitive conditions, represents a discovery that proved to be a major milestone in the field of physiology” (Waife et al. 185).&lt;/p&gt;","digestion; gastric acid; human experimentation; nontherapeutic human experimentation","Plattsburgh, United States","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain: submitted for the Observations of his Friends","","1811","&lt;p&gt;“In 1809, Charles Bell (1774-1842) wrote to his brother, George Joseph, ‘Could you get a little tiny book printed for me, of twenty pages of the smallest 8vo?’ When the booklet appeared in 1811, it was a bit longer than Bell had anticipated—thirty-six pages—but it was a milestone in neurology, because it contained the first reference in medical literature to the functions of the spinal nerve roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only one hundred copies of the pamphlet were printed, and Bell distributed these to his friends for comment. In the pamphlet, Bell maintained the different parts of the brain serve different functions. He had cut certain spinal-nerve roots in experimental animals and showed by the changes in their behavior that the nerves were anatomically ‘united for the convenience of distribution, but distinct in office.’ Such functional specificity, he deduced, was derived from the part of the brain with which the nerve was connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘On laying bare the roots of the spinal nerves,’ he wrote, ‘I found that I could cut across the posterior fasciculus of the nerves which took its origin from the posterior portion of the spinal marrow without convulsing the muscles of the back, but that, on touching the anterior fasciculus with the point of the knife, the muscles of the back were immediately convulsed.’ However, Bell failed to grasp the significance of this observation and classed all nerves as sensory, calling the posterior roots ‘sensible’ and the anterior roots ‘insensible.’ In a similar experiment eleven years later, Magendie provided clear proof that the anterior roots are motor, and Bell then accepted his findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bell was trained in Edinburgh but spent the busiest years of his active and productive life in London, where he was known as a surgeon, an anatomist, a teacher, and a writer. A two-volume &lt;i&gt;System of Operative Surgery&lt;/i&gt; brought him fame and success. He later joined the school founded by John and William Hunter. His talent for sketching and drawing was useful to him in illustrating his medical works. He published additional papers on the nervous system and subsequently collected them in &lt;i&gt;The Nervous System&lt;/i&gt; (1830). Bell was knighted in 1829 for his physiologic discoveries. He returned to his beloved Edinburgh in 1836 and held the chair of surgery at the University of Edinburgh until his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bell is remembered chiefly for his later demonstration of the sensory and motor functions of the fifth cranial nerve, for his discovery of the long thoracic nerve that bears his name, and for his description of the facial paralysis, known as Bell&#39;s palsy, which results from facial-nerve neuropathy” (Waife et al. 165). &lt;/p&gt;","nervous system; nervous system physiological phenomena; neurophysiology; physiology; spinal nerves; spinal nerve roots","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Leçons de physiologie expérimentale appliquée à la médecine","","1856","&lt;p&gt;“Claude Bernard (1813-1878) was the pupil of and assistant to François Magendie, whom he succeeded as professor at the Collège de France in 1855. There he continued Magendie&#39;s physiologic research with even greater intellectual power. He had started as a pharmacist&#39;s assistant in Lyons and, before qualifying as a physician, had had some success as a poet and playwright. The greatest of French physiologists, Bernard was the first scientist in his country to be honored with a public funeral at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bernard combined Magendie’s objectivity with enormous curiosity about the facts uncovered. That attitude is well summed up in his own words: ‘Put off your imagination, as you take off your overcoat, when you enter the laboratory; but put it on again, as you do your overcoat, when you leave the laboratory. Before the experiment and between whiles, let your imagination wrap you round; put it right away from you during the experiment itself lest it hinder your observing power.’ A contemporary of Charcot, Pasteur, Virchow, Addison, and Darwin, he lived during a period of intense scientific ferment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His classic book on experimental physiology laid the foundation for today’s understanding of physiology, metabolism, and endocrinology. It was based on his lectures, which were given in two courses in 1854 and 8155. In the first, after a preliminary exposition of the indivisibility of physiologic and pathologic research, Bernard described his investigation of glucose production, with special reference to diabetes. He had studied the chemistry of the liver and the blood and announced his discovery of the glycogenic function of the liver. The second course discussed the mechanical and chemical aspects of digestion, with emphasis on the chemistry and the digestive role of saliva and the properties and function of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bernard introduced the concept of ‘internal secretions’ and showed that all the relevant organs of the body cooperate in the general functions. He later elaborated his concept of the ‘&lt;i&gt;milieu intérieur&lt;/i&gt;.’ His subsequent lecture courses presented his discoveries on the effect of poisons, the pathology and physiology of the nervous system (particularly of the vasomotor nerves), body fluids, and anesthesia.

"Die allgemeine chirurgische Pathologie und Therapie . . . ","","1863","&lt;p&gt;“Billroth (1829-1894) graduated from the University of Gottingen in 1852 and showed interest in many branches of medicine before he settled into a career of surgery and pathologic anatomy. He was also an accomplished artist and musician. Three years after he had been appointed professor of surgery at Zurich in 1860, he published his course of lectures on surgical pathology and treatment in this ‘handbook for students and doctors,’ a work that was translated into many languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Billroth was particularly concerned with wound infections and discussed the surgical care of various classes of injuries and the diseases of the tissues arising from them. The book is arranged in twenty chapters that encompass the subject matter of fifty lectures. It describes the pathology and cure of all sorts of lesions and is exceptionally complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1867, Billroth moved to Vienna, where he was professor of surgery for more than twenty years. There he raised the medical school to a new peak of fame and taught many students who became leading surgeons of the next generation. He was a pioneer in surgery of the gastrointestinal tract and devised gastric operations for resection of the intestine in ulcers and in carcinomas of the stomach, surgical techniques that now bear his name. He was also the first surgeon to resect the esophagus and the first to perform a total laryngectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Curiously, this methodical man did not readily accept Lister’s findings and only belatedly appreciated the significance of the new science of bacteriology in relation to surgical sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to medicine, Billroth made contributions to the arts as a poet and a composer. His charming &lt;i&gt;Briefe&lt;/i&gt; was written as a memorial to his lifelong friend, the composer Johannes Brahms, with whom he had played chamber music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Billroth’s book is regarded as important because, more than any other, it linked the practice of surgery to the study of pathologic anatomy. No one else had so carefully studied the tissues removed surgically, and his operations truly earned their description as ‘autopsies &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;,’ a phrase that was coined in compliment” (Waife et al. 223).&lt;/p&gt;","pathologic anatomy; pathology, surgical","Berlin, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

It went through many editions and was translated even into Arabic and Turkish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boerhaave (1668-1738) exerted tremendous influence on medicine and related disciplines; he was an inspired teacher of clinical medicine, an experimental chemist, a botanist, and a consultant whose competence was recognized throughout Europe. He is credited with systematizing and synthesizing medical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boerhaave became a doctor of philosophy at the age of twenty-two and a doctor of physic at twenty-five. In 1701, when he was thirty-three, he was appointed lecturer in medicine at Leyden. Seven years later, his lectures were published in &lt;i&gt;Institutiones Medicae&lt;/i&gt;; in the preface, Boerhaave describes the text as ‘a little book which draws the lines within which my annual work with you is confined.’ It is divided into four sections: physiology, pathology, hygiene, and therapeutics. The title was used as the accepted name for courses on physiology and medical schools until well into the nineteenth century. Although he was not a great writer, his book was successful because of its simplicity, clarity, and eclectic wisdom. His warm personality and oratory gifts made his lectures extremely popular. The many students who flocked to Leyden soon spread his teachings over Europe and America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boerhaave revived the instruction methods of Hippocrates; He took his students to the bedside of the patient and, by skillful questioning, drew from them the information needed for diagnosing the disease. Although he had only twelve hospital beds at his disposal, he utilized them to the fullest; under his guidance, Leyden became the site of one of Europe’s most prestigious medical schools. Boerhaave also taught a private course on the theory of medical practice. The lectures from this course were published in &lt;i&gt;Aphorismi&lt;/i&gt; in 1709.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boerhaave was a cultured man with broad interests. He was an accomplished musician; he republished many ancient, renaissance, and contemporary text; he spoke five languages and could read in seven. Nobility and royalty from many countries visited him, but he said the poor were his best patients, ‘for God paid for them.’ He turned down several tempting offers of professorships from several leading universities to continue teaching at Leyden. It was said he was so popular that church bells once signaled his recovery from gout” (Waife et al. 105).&lt;/p&gt;","hygiene; pathology; physiology; therapeutics","Leiden, Netherlands","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De Motu Animalium","","1680-1681","&lt;p&gt;“Born in Naples, Borelli (1608-1679) was primarily a mathematician, a pupil of Galileo. He spent some years in Rome, and, in 1635, became lecturer in mathematics at the University of Messina. He stayed there for twenty years, extending his interests into many fields. There was an epidemic of malarial fevers and Sicily in 1647 and 1648, the cause of which he was commissioned to investigate. He concluded that they were caused by the entrance of some chemical substance into the body with the food or not, as was generally believed, by influence of the weather or the stars. He then became interested in the chemical aspects of digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Later he served as a professor of mathematics at Pisa for ten years period this brought him into contact with many investigators, notably Malpighi. Although Borelli was still mainly interested in mathematics, physics, and astronomy, he also studied the mechanics of physiology, investigating the kidney with his pupil Lorenzo Bellini and preparing this large volume on muscular activity. He returned to Messina in 1667 and there produced books on percussion and gravity, novel at the time but soon superseded by Newton&#39;s work. He fled Messina after involvement in a patriotic uprising against Spanish rule and spent his last years teaching at a boy’s school in Rome. Until his death in 1679, Borelli was also physician to the former Queen Christina of Sweden, in voluntary exile after her abdication. His great book on muscular motion was published posthumously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Borelli based his work on Harvey’s mathematical demonstration of the circulation of the blood, treating movements of the limbs and the internal organs and vessels in mechanical terms. However, he retained a hypothetical theory of ‘nervous juice,’ &lt;i&gt;succus nerveus&lt;/i&gt;; this fluid, he thought, caused muscle contraction by coursing through the nerves and producing fermentation with the liquids in the muscles. He erroneously believed that the process increased the bulk of contracting muscle, a view already disproved by Steno and Glisson. In spite of this error in hypothesis, Borelli’s observations contributed to the understanding of body movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His theory led him to explain the heartbeat as a simple muscular contraction activated by the nerves and to describe the circulation in simple hydraulic terms. He also contributed to the understanding of flight by calculating the mechanical relationship of the bird&#39;s wingbeat to the resistance of the air” (Waife et al. 91).&lt;/p&gt;","myography","Rome, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Memoirs for the Natural History of Humane Blood, Especially the Spirit of that Liquor","","1684","&lt;p&gt;“Robert Boyle (1627-1691) was the moving spirit in the group of English scientists who formed the Royal Society in 1660. He was a self-taught scientist, philosopher, theologian, and writer. His medical degree was not actually earned but was awarded by the Royal Society in recognition of his achievements. His interests were chiefly in chemistry, and his name remains familiar in Boyle’s law on the relationship of temperature, pressure, and volume of gases. In 1656, he assisted Sir Christopher Wren in the first intravenous injection, an experiment in which they injected opium and crocus metallorum into the veins of dogs. The procedure was not generally adopted, however, because it often led to thrombosis and embolism. Published more than forty books or pamphlets and contributed nearly as many papers to the &lt;i&gt;Philosophical Transactions&lt;/i&gt;. In the field of biology, his experiments with flames and with animals &lt;i&gt;in vacuo&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated that an unidentified element in the air was necessary for combustion as well as for life. A century later Lavoisier discovered the element to be oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this book on the blood, Boyle set forth a list of problems pertaining to whole blood, the serum, and the corpuscles. He then described his experiments and conclusions. He made a chemical analysis of human blood and discussed its affinity with the blood of ‘quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and sanguinous insects.’ Boyle easily obtained human blood for his experiments from barbers’ shops, where bloodletting was a daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He announced a similar list of problems concerning urine, but the subject is not pursued further. Medically, this volume is the most important of Boyle&#39;s writings. It summarizes contemporary knowledge of the chemical content of the blood and is the first scientific study in physiologic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There&#39;s an interesting point about the printing of this book. It was first issued over the date 1684, but Boyle later reissued it with a new title page dated 1683/4 to establish its time of publication precisely. In accordance with the usage of the period, the commercial new year began on the March ‘quarter day,’ whereas the people’s New Year was observed on January 1; thus, the first quarter of the layman’s 1684 was the last quarter of the businessman’s 1863.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In his will, Boyle left part of his estate for the advancement of the Christian religion. His executors implemented this by a bequest to ‘the corporation for propagating the Gospel amongst the heathen natives in New-England and other parts of America.’ By a circuitous route, the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, became the major beneficiary” (Waife et al. 93).&lt;/p&gt;","blood cells; vessels; cardiovascular system; empirical research; serum","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Reports of medical cases : selected with a view of illustrating the symptoms and cure of diseases by a reference to morbid anatomy","","1827-1831","&lt;p&gt;“Richard Bright (1789-1858), born in Bristol, was a brilliant and popular physician at Guy’s Hospital, London, for twenty-three years. He also lectured on clinical medicine and therapeutics and enjoyed an illustrious reputation as artist, collector, Continental traveler, and writer as well as accomplished botanist and geologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His &lt;i&gt;Reports of Medical Cases&lt;/i&gt;, published in two volumes, was a series of case histories that correlated clinical and pathologic findings. The first volume included twenty-three cases of kidney disease. In his preface, Bright noted that the book contained ‘statements and conjectures regarding the dependence of a peculiar class of dropsies on disease and irritation of the kidneys.’ Besides his historic differentiation of renal from cardiac dropsy, Bright established the symptomatology of chronic nonsuppurative nephritis, the ‘Bright’s disease’ that has immortalized his name. Although he had observed his first postmortem case of chronic nephritis in 1811, he published no reports on this disease until 1827, after being convinced by long and patient study of many cases that his findings were scientifically supportable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second volume was concerned mainly with diseases of the brain and spinal cord, including forty instances of cerebral hemorrhage. Bright presented cases of laryngeal tuberculosis, acne, and hydrocephalus, reported the relationship between chorea and rheumatism, and was the first to describe the administration of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;i&gt;Reports&lt;/i&gt; is a notable landmark in publishing, both for its important new knowledge and for its beautifully expressive colored engravings. Bright himself was an artist, but for these plates he supervised the drawings done for him by Frederick Richard Say and the aquatint engravings made from them by the artist’s father, William Say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Utility is my object,’ Bright stated in his preface, ‘and the work which I now commence will not, in theory at least, be thoroughly completed until every disease which influences the natural structure, or originates in its derangements, has been connected with a corresponding organic lesion.’ He went a long way toward realizing this ambitious plan, with later reports in areas that comprise neurology, cardiac disease, metabolic disorders, and infectious diseases. As he neared retirement, he was instrumental in the establishment of a forty-two-bed renal disease unit at Guy’s Hospital” (Waife et al. 183).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy; empirical research; glomerulonephritis","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"A Treatise of Melancholie","","1586","&lt;p&gt;“Timothy Bright (1551-1615), physician to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, for four years, was dismissed in 1591 for neglecting his duties and became a clergyman in Yorkshire. When his memorable &lt;i&gt;Treatise&lt;/i&gt; appeared, he had already published four medical books between 1580 and 1584. The &lt;i&gt;Treatise&lt;/i&gt; was printed in 1586 by Thomas Vautrollier, a reputable but somewhat careless printer. Consequently, the book contained many misprints and was not registered as the law required. Bright transferred the book to John Windet, who produced a more correct edition in October of the same year and later printed other books for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;A Treatise of Melancholie&lt;/i&gt; was the first thorough study of a psychosomatic condition, for Bright recognized that this peculiar affliction was primarily an illness of the mind that, in turn, profoundly affected the health of the body. His approach, indicative of his dual professions, was both medical and religious. Shakespeare later drew on this book for his characterization of Hamlet, not only using the medical matter but also echoing Bright’s phrases in Hamlet’s speeches. Furthermore, the &lt;i&gt;Treatise&lt;/i&gt; inspired Robert burton to write his large and more famous book on the same subject, &lt;i&gt;The Anatomy of Melancholy&lt;/i&gt; (1621).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bright’s &lt;i&gt;Treatise&lt;/i&gt; is closely printed on small pages and divided into forty-one chapters. The word ‘melancholie’ retained its first significance—a disease produced by an excess of ‘black bile’—but Bright’s treatment introduced the psychologic connotation it has since held. After debating whether it is congenital and therefore unpreventable ‘by fault of body,’  Bright describes how melancholy ‘worketh fearful passions in the mind,’ ‘how the body affecteth the soul,’ and how melancholy ‘procureth fear, sadness, despair,’ and he notices ‘how sickness and years alter the mind.’ He discusses the physical symptoms of melancholy—tears and sighing, weeping and laughing together, bashfulness, and the alteration of ‘natural actions.’ He differentiates melancholy from ‘the affliction of conscience for sin’ and shows that they can occur together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treatment and cure occupy the last quarter of the book. Bright maintains that patients must ‘order themselves’ in mind, in sense and motion, in affections, and in choice of air, meat, and drink; their houses are to be kept cheerful and ‘lightsome,’ trim and neat; and their apparel should be light, clean, and well fitting. He prescribes suitable medicines and advises ‘the manner of strengthening melancholic persons after purging’” (Waife et al. 51).&lt;/p&gt;","depressive disorder; mood disorders","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Nursing and Management of Children","","1748","&lt;p&gt;“Infant mortality in eighteenth-century London was as high as 50 percent. The majority of the inhabitants were poor, and children were often unwanted and subjected to neglect, whether they were born in or out of wedlock. One of the first attempts to correct this situation and provide a home for abandoned waifs was the establishment of the Foundling Hospital, which was opened in 1745.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cadogan (1711-1797), an Oxford graduate who had served aboard a hospital ship as a naval surgeon with John Hunter (q.v.) during the war with Spain, was physician to the Bristol Infirmary when he published this essay addressed to ‘One of the Governors of the Foundling Hospital.’ It was accepted by the committee of the hospital, which authorized its publication in 1752. Thereafter, Cadogan was appointed physician to the hospital and moved to London from his practice in Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In his opening sentences, Cadogan railed against the practices of mothers of the day: ‘You perceive, Sir, by the Hints I have already dropp’d, what I am going to complain of is, that children in general are over-cloath’d and over-fed, and fed and cloath’d improperly. To these Causes I impute almost all their Diseases. But to be a little more explicit. The first great Mistake is, that they think a new-born Infant cannot be kept too warm; from this Prejudice they load and bind it with Flannels, Wrappers, Swaths, Stays, &amp;c. . . . which all together are almost equal to its own Weight. . . . But what is worse than this, at the End of the Month, if things go on apparently well, this Hot-bed Plant is sent out into the Country, to be rear’d in a leaky House, that lets in Wind and Rain from every Quarter. Is it any Wonder the Child never thrives afterwards?’ Cadogan stressed the paramount importance of breast feeding, which was most necessary when the cleanliness of artificial feedings was suspect and the mixing of cow’s milk, sugar, and water in the correct proportions to simulate human milk was not yet understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book, though little more than a pamphlet, ran to at least twelve editions. For many years it was considered the most important pediatric text. In its day, it was an important innovative step in practical child care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1771, Cadogan published &lt;i&gt;A Dissertation on the Gout and All Chronic Diseases&lt;/i&gt;, of which ten reprintings were called for in two years. A sufferer from the disease himself, he recommended temperance for reducing the frequency of attacks.

One of the first attempts to correct this situation and provide a home for abandoned waifs was the establishment of the Foundling Hospital, which was opened in 1745.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cadogan (1711-1797), an Oxford graduate who had served aboard a hospital ship as a naval surgeon with John Hunter (q.v.) during the war with Spain, was physician to the Bristol Infirmary when he published this essay addressed to ‘One of the Governors of the Foundling Hospital.’ It was accepted by the committee of the hospital, which authorized its publication in 1752. Thereafter, Cadogan was appointed physician to the hospital and moved to London from his practice in Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In his opening sentences, Cadogan railed against the practices of mothers of the day: ‘You perceive, Sir, by the Hints I have already dropp’d, what I am going to complain of is, that children in general are over-cloath’d and over-fed, and fed and cloath’d improperly. To these Causes I impute almost all their Diseases. But to be a little more explicit. The first great Mistake is, that they think a new-born Infant cannot be kept too warm; from this Prejudice they load and bind it with Flannels, Wrappers, Swaths, Stays, &amp;c. . . . which all together are almost equal to its own Weight. . . . But what is worse than this, at the End of the Month, if things go on apparently well, this Hot-bed Plant is sent out into the Country, to be rear’d in a leaky House, that lets in Wind and Rain from every Quarter. Is it any Wonder the Child never thrives afterwards?’ Cadogan stressed the paramount importance of breast feeding, which was most necessary when the cleanliness of artificial feedings was suspect and the mixing of cow’s milk, sugar, and water in the correct proportions to simulate human milk was not yet understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book, though little more than a pamphlet, ran to at least twelve editions. For many years it was considered the most important pediatric text. In its day, it was an important innovative step in practical child care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1771, Cadogan published &lt;i&gt;A Dissertation on the Gout and All Chronic Diseases&lt;/i&gt;, of which ten reprintings were called for in two years. A sufferer from the disease himself, he recommended temperance for reducing the frequency of attacks. Although it was widely read, Cadogan’s advice was unpopular and received with much derision” (Waife et al. 117).&lt;/p&gt;","breast feeding; infant care; pediatrics","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Illustrations of the Elementary Forms of Disease","","1838","&lt;p&gt;“Robert Carswell (793-1857) studied medicine at Glasgow, was granted his medical degree by Aberdeen, and became professor of pathologic anatomy at University College, London. He had spent five years in Paris, where he made watercolor drawings of diseased tissues. In his illustrations, Carswell pursued a different purpose from that of a Parisian contemporary, Jean Cruveilhier, whose pathologic plates appeared in forty fascicles between 1828 and 1842. Cruveilhier’s work was an encyclopedia of case histories, fully described; Carswell’s book was a selection of representative renderings of diseased structures from some 2,000 drawings that he himself had made and copied onto lithographic stones for reproduction (The Lilly Library possesses two of his original drawings).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Carswell was chiefly interested in etiology and the pathologic process in tissues. Some diseases he illustrated, such as disseminated sclerosis, had not yet been described clinically. He dealt with gross naked eye pathology at a time when the microscopic researches of Schwann, Purkinje, Bowman, and others were just beginning to lay the foundation for Virchow’s belief that pathology must be studied at the cellular level. Although it has been suggested that, without the microscope, Carswell did not properly understand complicated tissue, the accuracy and color of his illustrations have never been surpassed. This Atlas is notable for the merit of its artwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The plate of osteomyelitis has been much admired, and among other markedly successful representations are those of bone sarcoma, cancer of the gallbladder, distension of the urethra, renal cysts, gastromalacia, bronchiectasis, and the scar tissue of burns. Each section of the Atlas has a lengthy introduction on the etiology, character, and progress of the general condition which the drawings illustrate. Carswell made frequent references to contemporary English and French work and discussed the opinions of earlier authorities. In the dedication to James Jeffray, he recalled that he ‘first attempted to represent by colored delineation the healthy and diseased appearances of the human body’ while attending Jeffray’s classes in Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Carswell proposed to publish the second edition with his illustrations of calculi, entozoa, and monstrosities, but this was not achieved. At the time he was holding his professorship, he also practiced as a physician in London. He was knighted by Queen Victoria and in 1840 moved to Brussels as physician to king Leopold of Belgium, an uncle of the queen” (Waife et al. 189).&lt;/p&gt;","osteomyelitis; pathologic anatomy; pathology, surgical","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De Vocis Auditusque Organis Historia Anatomica","","1600","&lt;p&gt;“Casserio (1552-1616) was pupil, assistant, and finally deputy of the famous Fabricius at Padua for nearly forty years. He might well have succeeded Fabricius to the chair of anatomy if his sudden death at the age of sixty-four had not preceded that of Fabricius by three years. Casserio was a keen comparative, as well as human anatomist and also a successful surgeon. His fame rests on his anatomic study of the organs of speech and hearing, &lt;i&gt;De Vocis Auditusque Organis Historia&lt;/i&gt;, in which the orientation is clinical and, to a lesser degree, physiologic. The drawings for this work were based on his extensive human and animal dissections and were exceptionally well executed by Joseph Maurer, whose plates have been called ‘the model for the copperplate illustrator.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This volume is composed of two separate books that were issued together, although the second, on the subject of hearing, is dated a year earlier than the first. Each book is divided into three sections—fabric (anatomy), function (phonation or acoustics), and uses (physiology). The record many original observations and correct deductions, especially on the innervation of the parts described. Most valuable is the detailed account of the larynx, in which Casserio’s dissections of a wide range of animals—mammals, birds, amphibians, and even insects—are compared with his human material. He gives the first accurate description of the laryngeal muscles and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Later he published a longer book on the organs of the five senses, &lt;i&gt;Pentaesthesion&lt;/i&gt; (1609), illustrated with thirty-three plates. This work was considered authoritative until more detailed studies were made by anatomists of the later seventeenth century, some of whose ‘discoveries’ he anticipated. For instance, he described both the antrum named for Highmore (1651) and the conjunctival glands named for Meibom (1666). Seventy-eight plates that he had prepared for an atlas of general anatomy were published after his death. These splendid and accurate drawings were made by Fialetti, a pupil of Tintoretto. They include clear delineations of the abdominal muscles and viscera, the blood vessels of the liver, and the peritoneum. Many of these structures had never been illustrated before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Casserio was one of the representatives of the golden age of the school of anatomy at Padua” (Waife et al.  57).&lt;/p&gt;","acoustics; ear, external; ear, inner; ear, middle; larynx; laryngeal muscles; physiology","Ferrara, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Andreae Caesalpini Aretini, medici clarissimi . . . Peripateticarum quaestionum libri quinque","","1571","&lt;p&gt;“Cesalpino (1519-1603), a physician and a naturalist, was not so much an innovator in Renaissance medicine as a man of philosophic outlook. In this volume, ‘Five Books of Peripatetic [i.e., Aristotelian] Questions’ (1571), he attempted a general survey of the medical and anatomic research of his contemporaries. Cesalpino had been a student at Padua under Matteo Realdo Colombo and may even have heard Vesalius lecture. He was only a few years younger than his teachers but long outlived them and practiced for many years in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aristotle&#39;s doctrines had been discussed in Italy since at least the thirteenth century, and Cesalpino tried to recapture Aristotle’s spirit of scientific inquiry, although he himself was a classifier rather than a discoverer. His best achievement as a naturalist was the introduction of a logical arrangement of plants based on their organs of fructification. This scheme of classification appeared in his &lt;i&gt;De Plantis, Libri XVI&lt;/i&gt;, published in Florence in 1583. He then revised the ‘Peripatetic Questions,’ producing an expanded edition in 1593, and followed it with a more thorough medical textbook in two parts: ‘The Art of Medicine—Universal Diseases’ in 1602 and ‘The Hippocratic Mirror [Speculum] of the Art of Medicine’ in 1605. In that work, Cesalpino recorded observations he had made on the blood vessels; these to some extent anticipated William Harvey&#39;s exposition in 1628 of the circulation of the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, in the &lt;i&gt;Quaestionum&lt;/i&gt; he made the first published statement concerning the centripetal flow of blood in the veins. Elsewhere he describes ‘continuous motion from the veins to the heart and from the heart to the arteries.’ In another place, he says that the very hot blood from the heart passes through the lungs to be cooled by the air. From these scattered observations it is possible to build up a theory of the circulation, but Cesalpino did not make the necessary synthesis, nor did he provide any experimental evidence to support his theory of blood circulation. It has been noticed that Harvey, who acknowledged indebtedness to hints from Colombo, Fabricius, and others, never once mentioned Cesalpino as a forerunner” (Waife et al. 45).&lt;/p&gt;","blood circulation; circulatory physiological phenomena; coronary circulation; physiology","Venice, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Before his death at the age of sixty-eight, he had transformed La Salpêtrière from a women’s prison—an asylum for the aged, infirm, and insane—into the greatest neurologic clinic of modern times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although he is remembered primarily for his contributions to neurology, Charcot’s first areas of interest were rheumatism, gout, and the diseases of the elderly. At the age of twenty-eight, he completed his doctoral thesis on the differential symptoms and lesions of gout and arthritis. His first professional post at La Salpêtrière was in pathologic anatomy; in 1882, when the department of neurology was created, he became its first professor and chairman and remained in that position until his death eleven years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1876, Charcot published his work on the localization of functions in cerebral and spinal disease. The book is clinically oriented and deals with such topics as hemiplegia and spinal lesions. Cerebral disorders are discussed in the first part and spinal disorders in the second. Small black-and-white illustrations clarify the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Charcot’s far-reaching interests and contributions are commemorated in the wide range of clinical entities that bear his name. Among these are the Charcot triad (intention tremor, nystagmus, and staccato speech) that occurs in multiple sclerosis; Charcot’s joint, a neuropathic arthropathy seen in diabetic polyneuritis, syringomyelia, and tabes dorsalis, in which articular cartilage and subjacent bone degenerate and result in joint instability; and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or peroneal muscular atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Charcot brought order into the classification of nervous diseases and was a pioneer in psychotherapy. Freud worked with him for a few months in 1885 and later translated Charcot’s lectures into German. Charcot defined hysteria as ‘a condition induced by purely mental processes;’ it depended, he said, on the subject’s susceptibility to suggestion and did not arise from organic lesions in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only was Charcot a superb teacher who could mimic tics, spasms, rigidity, and other symptoms for his students, but his skill as a clinician was recognized internationally. He described multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tabetic arthropathies, and spastic paralysis.

"The Anatomy of the Bones","","1733","&lt;p&gt;“Cheselden (1688-1752) became surgeon to St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1718 and was an outstanding teacher of anatomy in London during the first half of the eighteenth century. &lt;i&gt;Osteographia&lt;/i&gt;, his third book, is a monumental study of ‘all the bones of the human body displayed in their natural size.’ It contains fifty-six large plates of the human bones, with forty-four comparative anatomy vignettes, chiefly animal skeletons. Although the latter were intended as mere ornamental supplements, they constitute the first accurate delineations of some of the species shown. The book was clearly inspired by Vesalius’s &lt;i&gt;Fabrica&lt;/i&gt;, but Cheselden pointed out that Vesalius’s illustrations were sometimes imprecise in detail.

"De Ratione Motus Musculorum","","1664","&lt;p&gt;“William Croone (1633-1684), a London physician, was an associate of the great Robert Boyle and an original Fellow of the Royal Society. He was lecturer on the anatomy of the muscles to the Company of Surgeons in London, a position he held for the last fourteen years of his life. His most notable contributions to medicine were his monographs on muscle physiology and on the embryology of the chick, both of which were published after the essay on muscular movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The treatise on muscular motion was an attempt to give a rational account of muscle contraction. Accepting the then-current belief that the action of the nerves was affected by ‘nervous spirit,’ he suggested that this fluid was a ‘spiritous liquor,’ a rectified and ‘enriched juice,’ which interacted with the blood and other substances in the muscle to produce contraction. Yet he hinted that the nerve impulse consisted of vibrations along the nerve that was in a state of tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The year after the publication of his essay, Croone met Nicolaus Steno and learned of a new—and still unpublished—discovery: that muscles do not enlarge when in contraction. In spite of this new knowledge, Croone proceeded to develop his theory of contraction, suggesting that each individual muscle fiber contained small bladders to receive the increased fluids supplied from the nerves. The series of lectures in which this refined theory was presented was delivered in 1674-1675 but was not published until 1681. Before the lectures appeared in book form, Francis Glisson stated, in 1677, that muscle does not increase in volume when it contracts. Glisson’s conclusion, made with the authority of long experience, overshadowed Croone’s theory even in his lifetime. Croone is perhaps best remembered from the famous Croonian Lectures; these were endowed by his widow from the fortune that she inherited at his death in 1684” (Waife et al. 75).&lt;/p&gt;","extracellular fluid; nervous system; nervous system physiological phenomena; neurophysiology; physiology","London, England","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

All of them had published valuable reports, but it was Cruikshank’s book that gave the definitive account of the human lymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part 1 of the book is a digest of earlier writings on the ‘Absorbing Vessels and their Glands in those animals in general in which they have yet been found,’ and Part 2 is the anatomic description of the human lymphatic system.

"The Effects of Water as a Remedy in Fever","","1797","&lt;p&gt;“James Currie (1756-1805) emigrated from Scotland to Virginia as a young man in 1775, hoping to make his fortune. At the opening of the Revolution, he published a loyalist manifesto, made a hazardous escape to Britain, and began medical studies at Edinburgh in 1777. He practiced in Liverpool with great success from 1780 until shortly before his death at the age of forty-nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currie was interested in literature and politics as well as medicine. He attacked the slave trade at a time when Liverpool was its shipping center, wrote against the repressive policy of the British government during the war with republican France, and campaigned for better care for French prisoners of war, which earned him notoriety as an unpatriotic revolutionary. For the benefit of Robert Burns’s family, he edited the first collection of his poems, but in so doing he annoyed the poet’s idolaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the time of his student days, Currie advocated sponging and bathing with cold water for treating fever; in his book of 1797, he gave the first precise directions for such procedures and showed the need to measure body temperature during the process. William Wright, after long practice in Jamaica, had published a paper in 1786 describing cold-water baths as successful therapy for fever, and a year after Currie’s book appeared, Robert Jackson, a British army surgeon, reported similar success with typhus and yellow fever. However, neither of these writers considered measuring body temperature repeatedly to determine when a cold bath would do the most good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The term ‘fever’ was still employed in the late eighteenth century to characterize specific disease, especially typhus, although physicians knew that fever was a symptom of many different conditions. This ambiguity lingered in Currie’s writing. His book began with a recital of Wright’s 1786 report. He then described his own experience at Liverpool with ‘cold affusions’ followed by sea bathing. He explained ‘the manner in which the affusion of cold water ought to be used’; namely, ‘from six to nine in the evening, or at any time of the day when there is no sense of chilliness, when the heat of the surface is steadily above what is natural, and when there is no general or profuse sensible perspiration.’ To measure body temperature, Currie first tried ‘a small mercurial thermometer of great sensibility after a form invented by Mr. Hunter and used in his experiments on animals,’ but he soon modified this to an ‘instrument with a small bulb and curved at the end, introduced under the tongue’” (Waife et al. 149). &lt;/p&gt;","fever; fever, therapy; hydrotherapy; therapeutics","Liverpool, England","","","","compound_object","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"The Pituitary Body and Its Disorders","","1912","&lt;p&gt;“Harvey Cushing (1869-1939), the principal pioneer in neurologic surgery in the United States, believed the surgeon should equip himself in detail with all the disciplines that support his practice, adding the active study of physiology, therapeutics, and pathology to his technical expertise. He was born in Cleveland, graduated from Yale University, received his medical degree from Harvard, and then spent fourteen years at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he worked under Halsted in surgery and Osler in medicine. Many years later, after the latter’s death, Cushing wrote &lt;i&gt;The Life of Sir William Osler&lt;/i&gt;, for which he won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize. He returned to Harvard University in 1912 as professor of surgery and also became surgeon-in-chief at the then-new Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. Forced to retire from Harvard at the age of sixty-three, he joined the faculty at Yale, where he spent the rest of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This monograph on the pituitary displays his comprehensive scientific approach. It begins with a brief account of the anatomy, physiology, pathology, and chemistry of the hypophysis. The main text, on clinical manifestations of disordered function, is a detailed discussion of forty-seven cases. The last part of the book is a survey of the incidence, symptomatology, and treatment of pituitary disorders, including his new operative methods. The work on the pituitary was followed by his &lt;i&gt;Papers Relating to the Pituitary Body&lt;/i&gt; (1932), which reported more of his research in that field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By the time he wrote his first major monograph, Cushing was already an internationally famous surgeon with a long record of successful research in anesthesia, bacteriology, hypertension, and the control of hemorrhage. He had also performed experimental thoracic surgery on dogs (anticipating lung surgery in man, which he lived to see) and heart surgery (which began soon after his death in 1939 at the age of seventy). Cushing continuously extended his knowledge and treatment of intracranial tumors and published five books on aspects of this research between 1917 and 1938. In addition to his surgical practice and investigations, Cushing was a scholar, historian, and biographer, with an expert’s knowledge of the medical books of the Renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cushing’s writing on what he called ‘dyspituitarism’ stimulated interest in the wide-ranging effects of the ductless glands and helped establish endocrinology as a separate medical specialty. Of course, he is eponymically immortalized by the syndrome that bears his name. His personality and energy had a profound influence on a generation of surgical teachers” (Waife et al. 261).&lt;/p&gt;","hyperpituitarism; hypopituitarism; physiology; pituitary diseases; polyendocrinopathies, autoimmune","Philadelphia, United States","","","","compound_object","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De Homine Figuris et Latinitate Donatus a Florentio Schuyl","","1662","&lt;p&gt;“‘On Man,’ considered by many to be the first important textbook on physiology, reflects the firm conviction of Descartes (1596-1650) that all physiologic processes were consequences of the laws of mathematics and physics. Organs were compared to machines, biologic functions to mechanical processes. Descartes’s interpretations of his observations were speculative; he set out from what he knew to find the cause of what he saw. Although he performed a wide range of animal dissections and chemical manipulations, he never fully grasped the scientific method of hypothesis tested by experiment. Nevertheless, most of the experimentalists who made such great advances in knowledge late in the 17th century were deeply influenced by his mechanistic approach, which allowed them to discard traditional conceptual explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These two treatises were published posthumously. ‘On Man’ (&lt;i&gt;De Homine&lt;/i&gt;) was translated from the French manuscript into Latin by Schuyl, who took some liberties with the text and the illustrations. The French edition two years later was an accurate representation of Descartes’s original manuscript and artwork and included his essay on the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The volume on man considers the Organism as an automaton and discusses ‘the machine of the body’ and ‘how the machine moves.’ The workings of the interior and the external senses, particularly vision, are explained. The book ends with a discourse on ‘animal spirits’ and the function of brain and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The treatise on the formation of the fetus is more speculative and dogmatic. It is based on a conceptual picture of the corpuscles of the male and female seeds fermenting together to create the heart and lungs, the blood, sense organs, and nerves; later these coalesce to make the tissues that grow together to form the solid parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From his mother, Descartes is said to have inherited both weak lungs and enough property to free him for philosophic pursuits. He learned mathematics and physics from Jesuit teachers, whose school he entered at the age of ten. After finishing his formal education (he graduated in law at the age of twenty), he lived in Holland and Germany, traveled in Italy, and sought intellectual stimulation among the natural scientists and philosophers of Paris. Some of his interests in physics and mathematics come to us in such expressions as Cartesian geometry, Cartesian coordinates, and Cartesian diver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He lived in Holland from 1628 to 1649 and then moved to Sweden in Queen Christina’s invitation. The harsh weather of Stockholm was too severe for his weak lungs, and he died at the age of fifty-three, a great philosopher, mathematician, and scientist” (Waife et al. 81).&lt;/p&gt;","cardiovascular system; nervous system; philosophy, medical;","Leiden, Netherlands","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Materia Medica","","1529","&lt;p&gt;“For fifteen hundred years, the writings of Dioscorides, a Greek physician and surgeon of the first century who served in Nero’s army, were regarded as the ultimate authority on materia medica. Dioscorides described more than six hundred plants and plant principles encountered during his army service in the lands around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. The compendium, written in Greek, noted the plants’ botanic characteristics and their real or traditional medical properties. Almost one hundred of these plants still serve a pharmaceutical purpose today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although opium had been in use for centuries, Dioscorides was the first to write about its virtues, to point out its great benefits in the relief of pain, insomnia, and chronic cough, and to note its dangerous effects, particularly those of overdose. He was also the first to describe the medicinal usefulness of aloes, ammoniac, aconite, and ginger. He invented the name ‘&lt;i&gt;hydrargyrum&lt;/i&gt;’ (liquid silver) for mercury; he recommended iron for uterine hemorrhage and aspidium for tapeworm infestation; and he was the first to state the need for testing the purity of drugs. Among the methods he advised for detecting adulteration were drug solubility, specific gravity, and reaction to ignition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dioscorides also dealt with animal and mineral products useful in medicine and discussed diet and wines. He suggested mandragora wine for insomnia and pain and specifically for analgesia during surgery. An astute observer, Dioscorides recognized family relationships between plants seventeen centuries before Linnaeus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By the sixth century, the poorly organized compendium had been rearranged alphabetically, illustrations of plants had been added, and a Latin translation had been made. The book was translated during the following centuries into most of the languages of the modern and ancient world, including Arabic in the ninth century. The first printed edition, a Latin version, appeared in Italy in 1478, and the original Greek text was published in Venice in 1499. The revival of the teachings of Dioscorides during the Renaissance laid the foundations for scientific botany and pharmacy. Unfortunately, because all plants were thought to be universally distributed, a great deal of time and ingenuity were wasted in trying to equate western flora with the plants described by Dioscorides” (Waife et al. 21).&lt;/p&gt;","materia medica; medicine, traditional; phytotherapy; therapeutics","Basel, Switzerland","","","","image/jpg","Greek","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"The Principal Diseases of the Interior Valley of North America","","1850, 1854","&lt;p&gt;“Drake’s heroic subject was the North American continent—its topography, meteorology, and ethnology as they related to the health of its people. In the preface of his monumental work, he stated that he had begun forty years previously to make “personal observations from Florida to Canada of the causes, symptoms, pathology, and treatment’ of the diseases prevailing in the midlands of the continent, into which men of European origin and their African slaves were rapidly spreading. This is an epic record of the physical state of the nation during the decades of the westward movement and offers a physician’s view of health and sickness among the peoples of a vast and diversified region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drake (1785-1852) died after only half his papers had been published; the second book was edited and issued posthumously in 1854. The first volume surveyed the ‘topographical and hydrographical etiology’ of disease in twelve areas that extended north and east from the Delta of the Mississippi through the Ohio and St. Lawrence basins and from the Great Lakes to the Arctic. He discussed the climate (including the prevalent winds and storms) and its effects on health, dealing particularly with the central areas around St. Louis and Cincinnati. He also described ‘physiological and social etiology,’ population, and the modes of living of the inhabitants, such as their occupations and recreations. This book included the first part of Drake’s strictly medical reports, with chapters on ‘autumnal fever.’ The twenty-seven chapters of the posthumous volume contained the remainder of these medical reports, classified under five different types of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drake was a picturesque character. Restless, critical, and combative by nature, he was a crusader for improved medical education in the frontier lands. He filled successively seven teaching positions in the Midwest and founded two medical faculties—the Medical College of Ohio (1821) and the medical department of Cincinnati College (1835). He established a western medical journal, and in it appeared his celebrated series of essays on medical education, eminently readable even today. In these, he strongly criticized the way physicians were being prepared for their profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tall, commanding, and dignified in appearance, he lectured with fiery eloquence but was also endowed with a gentle sense of humor, as can be seen by his entertaining writings on pioneer life” (Waife et al. 203).&lt;/p&gt;","climatology, epidemiologic factors; geography, medical; malaria; topography, medical","Philadelphia, USA","","","","compound_object","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Die experimentelle Chemptherapie der Spirillosen","","1910","&lt;p&gt;“Ehrlich (1854-1915), the great German pathologist and bacteriologist, combined medical and chemical interests in his histologic studies with aniline dyes. While examining sputum samples for the bacilli that cause tuberculosis, he accidentally discovered that the organisms would stain readily if the slides were exposed to heat during the staining procedure. Characteristically modest, he gave credit for the finding to the cleaning woman who, when tidying the laboratory, had inadvertently placed his slides on a hot stove. Ehrlich developed the differential white-blood-cell count as a tool for the diagnosis of leukemia and was the first to recognize aplastic anemia and to describe the red-blood-cell inclusion bodies seen in toxic hemolytic disorders. From hematology, he turned to antitoxins and the problems of immunity. Ehrlich’s side-chain theory, in which he postulated the production of immunologically specific antibodies against invading microorganisms, ultimately won him universal recognition. For his contributions to the study of infectious disease and immunity, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 1908, which he shared with Elie Metchnikoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1899, he moved to the Institute of Experimental Therapy in Frankfurt and was later appointed its director.

"Die experimentelle Chemptherapie der Spirillosen","","1910","&lt;p&gt;“Ehrlich (1854-1915), the great German pathologist and bacteriologist, combined medical and chemical interests in his histologic studies with aniline dyes.

"La dissection des parties du corps humain divisée en trois livres","","1546","&lt;p&gt;“It is ironic that a lawsuit should have delayed publication of this book on anatomy and dissection for at least five years. As a result, when the Latin version finally appeared in 1545, it was overshadowed by Vesalius’s masterpiece, &lt;i&gt;De Humani Corporis Fabrica&lt;/i&gt;, which had been issued two years earlier. Vesalius may well have seen Estienne’s drawings while he was working in Paris from 1533 to 1536 and may have been inspired to improve upon them. Certainly Estienne’s plates, the earliest of which was dated 1530, are lower in quality (especially the skeletons) than those in Vesalius’s book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Charles Estienne (1504-1564), who belonged to a famous family of scholar-printers, began his career as a student of natural history. He turned to anatomy through his association with a surgeon, Estienne de la Rivière, and finally qualified in medicine in 1540. By that time, the text of this book had been virtually completed. Publication was then delayed, however, because La Rivière sought an injunction from the Paris courts to compel Charles Estienne to display his name on the title page as co-author. The case dragged on for several years before La Rivière achieved his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although the book was surpassed by Vesalius’s &lt;i&gt;Fabrica&lt;/i&gt;, it was not a failure. This French translation appeared a year after the original Latin version, and both editions, it has been said, are ‘exciting spectacles, even in the shadow of Vesalius.’ The text and the illustrations, moreover, reflect what was known and taught in Paris, site of the most influential medical school in northern Europe at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The illustrations are of considerable artistic interest, for the authors adapted existing art forms to display their new understanding of anatomy. The first ‘book’ includes fifteen full-page, full-length plates of human figures, depicting skeletons, muscles, and the systems of veins and nerves. Nerves, for instance, hang ‘in ribbons’ around the skeleton. The second section, which describes the male viscera, contains illustrations based on baroque designs with the figures in dramatic poses. In the third book, the plates showing female organs present nudes with the viscera viewed somewhat ludicrously through a window in the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estienne did not reshape anatomic thought as Vesalius did; he presented only what his eyes showed him. His text records many original observations, especially on the bones, nerves, and veins and on the technique of dissection” (Waife et al. 33).&lt;/p&gt;","cardiovascular system; digestive system; musculoskeletal system; nervous system; vascular system","Paris, France","","","","image/jpg","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Tabulae anatomicae","","1714","&lt;p&gt;“Eustachio, or Eustachius (1520-1574), is considered to have been the most scientific anatomist of the High Renaissance.  Although the plates that illustrated his distinctly original observations were engraved by 1552, they remained unprinted for 160 years. Early in the eighteenth century, they were found in the Vatican Library and presented by Pope Clement XI to his physician, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, who in 1714 published the forty-seven plates with his own notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whereas Vesalius designed his illustrations to exhibit nature as he had observed it (however artistically the figures were posed), Eustachius drew anatomic types based on study of many different cadavers. Although he, too, arranged his figures in lifelike poses, he was more interested in accurate proportions. This is emphasized by the frame and scale of measurement around each plate. Thus, the whole picture is both representational and mathematically exact. Vesalius’s artist had employed wood engraving with its strong contrast, but Eustachius preferred the newer copper engraving, which permitted a more delicate delineation of detail. By juxtaposition of drawings, he also contrived to show front-and-back and left-and-right views of the same figure. Among the best plates are those displaying the base of the brain and the sympathetic nervous system, the relationships of blood vessels and muscles, and the structure of the larynx. Many of the illustrations present the component parts of a particular system; each part is identified by a Roman numeral that corresponds to a discussion in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eustachius himself had published an important small volume, &lt;i&gt;Opuscula Anatomica&lt;/i&gt; (‘Little Works on Anatomy’), which contained chapters on the kidneys, the organs of hearing, the bones, the motions of the head, the azygos vein, and the common deep vein of the arm. A companion treatise on the teeth gave the first accurate account of their structure. Eustachius’s essay on the veins shows advanced knowledge of the heart structure. The eustacian tube, named for him, was first described in the section on the organs of hearing. The treatise on the kidney is his best work and is illustrated by eight excellent small plates which, like his large anatomy plates, were designed with a graduated border. Among his other original observations is the first account of the adrenals” (Waife et al. 41).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, regional; education, medical","Rome, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De Venarum Ostiolis","","1603","&lt;p&gt;“Geronimo Fabrizio d’Acquapendente (1537-1619), better known by his Latinized name, Hieronymus Fabricius, taught anatomy in the famous medical school of Padua for nearly fifty years. He was also a successful practicing surgeon. His work on veins undoubtedly inspired his pupil William Harvey to study the functioning of the cardiovascular system, although Fabricius himself did not draw far-reaching physiologic conclusions from his own anatomic observations of the circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The presence of valves in the veins had been known for at least the middle of the sixteenth century, but Fabricius gave the first complete description of them in his brief essay. Printed in very large format, the book’s twenty-three pages include eight full-page illustrations. The second occupies a two-page spread and shows the veins at the inner surface of the arm, which is stretched out as if for bloodletting. Harvey adapted this plate in reduced size for the illustrations in his epoch-making treatise published in 1628, in which he announced and expounded his discovery of the circulation of the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although he was an indefatigable worker whose accurately recorded observations give him high rank as a medical biologist, Fabricius was a traditionalist. He dissected a great variety of animals and birds without comparing their homologies. He postulated a local, almost entirely structural, purpose for the organs he dissected and did not extend his opinions to wider physiologic horizons as did Harvey and the later seventeenth-century anatomists. The term he used for the valves, &lt;i&gt;’ostiola’&lt;/i&gt;, implies small sluice gates in a stream, and he thought of them as serving to slow down the blood flow and maintain an even distribution of blood to the parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fabricius intended to prepare a survey of the whole animal ‘fabric,’ to repeat Vesalius’s term. Toward this he gathered colored illustrations of comparative anatomic subjects, which still remain on view in Venice. He published instead a series of special studies between 1600 and 1618 on anatomic and physiologic subjects and on Embryology. This book is the fourth of ten such monographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is significant that there is a direct teacher-student line from Vesalius to Fallopius to Fabricius to Harvey” (Waife et al. 59).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy; anatomy, regional; blood circulation; circulatory physiological phenomena; coronary circulation; physiology","Padua, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Observationes Anatomicae","","1561","&lt;p&gt;“Falloppio, or Fallopius (1523-1562), of Modena, was an influential teacher of anatomy at Padua, where for eleven years he occupied the famous chair not long vacated by his teacher, Vesalius. The year before his death, he published this one book, &lt;i&gt;Observationes Anatomicae&lt;/i&gt;. The small, thick volume is mainly a commentary on some points made by Vesalius in the &lt;i&gt;Fabrica&lt;/i&gt; rather than a formal treatise. However, it did present many new discoveries and thus displayed Falloppio’s  independent achievement. In form, it is a long, continuous narrative without summary, index, or illustrations. (The text includes a tabular classification of the different kinds of joints.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although a great admirer of Vesalius, whom he called ‘divine’—or, as we might say, ‘inspired’—Falloppio did not hesitate to point out where his own dissections had shown the master to be wrong. He sent a copy of his book to the famous anatomist, then at the Spanish court, where he had gone as physician to Emperor Charles V, and Vesalius wrote a courteous reply dated December 17, 1561. Vesalius, who was then still under fifty, hoped to return to research again at Padua. Falloppio then died of tuberculosis before receiving Vesalius’ answer, and Vesalius died on the Greek island of Zante in the Ionian Sea in 1564 on his way home from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The text of his answer to Falloppio was published by friends later that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Falloppio’s most original contribution was made in his dissections and discussions of the female reproductive organs. He first clearly differentiated and named several special structures and, in particular, described the oviducts named for him. He himself employed the Latin term &lt;i&gt;tuba&lt;/i&gt;, a trumpet, to indicate their trumpet-shaped lateral extremities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Falloppio added to knowledge of the centers of ossification and described the primary teeth and their replacement. He improved on earlier accounts of the muscles of the head and face and also made numerous discoveries concerning nerve pathways.

"The Functions of the Brain","","1876","&lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the theory that nervous control of function is localized in special areas of the brain was elaborated, without genuine anatomic evidence, in the pseudoscience of phrenology. Research by Flourens in the 1820’s had suggested that such localization was general, not specific. During the 1860’s, the problem was explored in England, France, and Germany. The discoveries made there were extensively corroborated by David Ferrierr in the 1870’s, before he made his own contribution to our knowledge of the central-nervous-system functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Born in Scotland, Ferrier (1843-1928) became professor of forensic medicine at King’s College, London. In 1873, while working at the West Riding Lunatic Asylum in Yorkshire, he combined clinical observation of nervous diseases with experimental research on any species of animals, utilizing electrical stimulation of the brain cortex. He summarized his work in the Croonian lectures before the Royal Society in 1874. These lectures were ultimately published in his book, which he characterized as ‘a systematic exposition of the bearing of my own experiments.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The volume consists of thirteen chapters. Ferrier sketched the structure of the brain and then described the functions he had located in its various parts. He discussed the phenomena of electrical irritation, the physiologic and psychologic aspects of the brain hemispheres (including the problem of mind, with aphasia and inhibition), and then the functions of the basal ganglia. He concluded with a diagrammatic survey of cerebral and cranial topography and, from his clinical and pathologic discoveries, noted the homologies between his observations in man and his experimental findings in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His Gulstonian lectures on &lt;i&gt;The Localization of Cerebral Disease&lt;/i&gt; (1878) provided the clinical and pathologic complement to Ferrier’s mainly experimental work, and in 1889 he was appointed to a professorship of neuropathology at King’s College. Ultimately, he received a knighthood for his contributions to neurology, which have come to be regarded as the foundation upon which all of our present knowledge concerning the localization of cerebral functions has been built” (Waife et al. 231).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, regional; electric stimulation; neurophysiology; neuropathology; pathology; physiology ","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Antibiotics. A Survey of Penicillin, Streptomycin, and Other . . .","","1949","&lt;p&gt;“The introduction of penicillin was the most dramatic advance in the treatment of infectious disease since Jenner’s cowpox vaccine. In 1921, Alexander Fleming identified lysozyme, a valuable antibacterial enzyme that is present in many animal tissues. He made a second and even more historic discovery eight years later, when he observed the inhibiting effect of the mold &lt;i&gt;Penicillium&lt;/i&gt; on bacterial growth. Unfortunately, he failed to stabilize its extracts sufficiently for any practical application beyond laboratory use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Howard Florey, professor of pathology at Oxford, selected Fleming’s penicillin for special study in 1938 when, with the help of the biochemist Ernst B. Chain, he began an intensive search for antibacterial agents. They purified penicillin and found it so promising that they devoted their whole laboratory to the production of material for clinical trials. These succeeded dramatically in 1941. In the urgency of war demands, Florey turned to his American friends for large-scale development. The next thirty months saw an unprecedented coalition of the industrial, academic, and governmental research facilities of two countries (see facing page). By 1944, penicillin was being produced in quantities sufficient for treating the casualties of World War II, and soon after this it was available for nonmilitary clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Florey, Chain, and Fleming were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1945 for their significant contribution to medicine. It is interesting that, during the 1950’s, at Florey’s suggestion, the Oxford laboratories pioneered in the discovery and development of the cephalosporin family of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this great two-volume survey, &lt;i&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/i&gt;, Florey and his team reviewed the first decade of their achievement.

Other chapters describe the many antibiotics derived from natural sources and discuss their modes of action on bacteria. Eighty-four pages of bibliographic citations of journal articles on antibiotics are included.

The rapid proliferation of scientific data and specialized journals in addition to technical advances leading to prompt printing and dissemination has revolutionized the spread of information.

"Syphilis sive Morbus Gallicus","","1530","&lt;p&gt;“Although Fracastoro (c. 1478-1553) made a truly original contribution to medical knowledge with his book on contagion, he is best known for the word ‘syphilis,’ a scholarly frivolity that he coined for the title of his first book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the ‘great pox,’ or ‘French disease,’ swept through Europe, Fracastoro, scholar as well as physician in Verona, composed a mock-heroic Latin poem, &lt;i&gt;Syphilis&lt;/i&gt;, for his Venetian patron, Cardinal Pietro Bombo. The poem described the course of the disease and its treatment with mercury in the story of an imaginary shepherd, Syphilus. However, by 1525, when the poem was finished, treatment with mercury ointment was in disrepute because of its side-effects. It had been superseded by guaiacum, the ‘sacred wood’ of the American Indian. Guaiacum was imported by Spain about 1508, and three thousand cures had been claimed for it within a decade. Fracastoro therefore added a third section to his poem, telling how Syphilus was cured of the great pox by ritual treatment with the ‘sacred wood.’ The title of the poem, &lt;i&gt;Syphilis&lt;/i&gt;, soon became universally adopted as the name of the affliction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fracastoro had wide-ranging interests. Physics and its instruments, geology and maps, and astronomy and telescopes all benefited from his work while he continued to write poetry and practice medicine. In 1546, he published his most important medical treatise, &lt;i&gt;De Contagione&lt;/i&gt;. This book consists of a short theoretical discourse on sympathy and antipathy in physics and a longer, more practical account of contagion and contagious diseases. Here, for the first time, was a clear description of the spread of disease by &lt;i&gt;‘seminaria contagionum’&lt;/i&gt;, the seeds of infection—the suggestion of the germ theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;De Contagione&lt;/i&gt; is arranged in three ‘books.’ The first explained the mechanism of contagion, how &lt;i&gt;seminaria&lt;/i&gt; can be carried a distance, and why only some diseases are contagious. In the second book he wrote about a series of contagious diseases. Fracastoro had made careful observations; he differentiated smallpox from measles, gave the earliest precise description of typhus, and showed that tuberculosis was contagious.

However, by 1525, when the poem was finished, treatment with mercury ointment was in disrepute because of its side-effects. It had been superseded by guaiacum, the ‘sacred wood’ of the American Indian. Guaiacum was imported by Spain about 1508, and three thousand cures had been claimed for it within a decade.

"Traité des hernies . . . et autres excellentes parties de la chirurgie, assavoir de la pierre, des cataractes des yeux, &amp; autres maladies . . .","","1561","&lt;p&gt;“Pierre Franco (1500-1561), a native of Turriers in Provence, practiced as a surgeon in the south of France. In the sixteenth century, men like him who operated for stones or repaired hernias were usually itinerant surgeons, often regarded with some doubt by the apothecaries and physicians, who considered them mercenaries. Franco, however, apart from an interval spent in Switzerland as a Huguenot refugee at the time of the Waldensian massacres, spent most of his life in Orange, where he established himself as a respected professional. His books also helped greatly to elevate the status of the humble practitioners who performed lithotomy and were forerunners of the modern surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1556, Franco published a ‘Little Treatise on Surgery Such as the Hernia Surgeons Perform.’ It was followed five years later by this more complete and useful small, thick book. Although the treatise on hernias is dedicated to Jacques Roy, ‘Lieutenant of the Master-Surgeons of Lyons,’ it also contains a nine-year copyright privilege from the king of France and a license to print from the provost of the Sworn Surgeons of Paris. These legal authorizations suggest that Franco wished to make his book known not only in the south, where he lived, but all over France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Written in the vernacular, the book provides the first practical and precise account of the surgery of hernias, stones in the bladder, and cataracts. It is well illustrated with full-page woodcuts, including clear diagrams of instruments and three drawings of skeletons copied from Vesalius but reduced in size. Franco was the first surgeon to record operative cure of a strangulated hernia and the first to perform suprapubic cystotomy. There is a kind of genius in his pioneering achievements” (Waife et al. 37).&lt;/p&gt;","hernia; internal hernia; kidney calculi; surgery","Lyons, France","","","","image/jpg","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Some account of the success of inoculation for the small-pox in England and America : together with Plain instructions, by which any person may be enabled to perform the operation, and conduct the patient through the distemper.","","1759","&lt;p&gt;“Although not a physician, the remarkable Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) made many valuable contributions to medicine. He was a founder and the first president of the Pennsylvania Hospital, of which he wrote a history. He invented the bifocal lens and a flexible catheter and wrote on the use of electricity for the treatment of paralysis. This treatment was named for him (franklinization). He also studied and wrote about lead poisoning, night blindness, sleep, the ‘heat’ of blood, the infectious nature of colds, infection from cadavers, the infant death rate, and medical education. His &lt;i&gt;Dialogue with Gout&lt;/i&gt; (1759) is of special interest because he himself suffered from this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public health was one of Franklin&#39;s many interests, but at first he opposed smallpox inoculation, which at the time was indeed dangerous. Later, when his youngest son died of the disease, he regretted his opposition and became an advocate. Variolation, the practice of inoculating humans with dried, unmodified matter to prevent contagious smallpox, had been introduced into Western Europe from Turkey about 1720. In England it was strongly advocated by Dr. Richard Mead, the leading London physician. However, it was not until the 1750’s, when severe epidemics of smallpox recurred, that variolation became general. While he was in England between 1757 and 1762 as agent for the Pennsylvania Assembly, Franklin gathered statistics from both English and American sources to present a strong argument in favor of variolation. He published these in his pamphlet, together with ‘Plain Instructions’ for inoculation. The latter were written at his request by a London physician who has been variously identified as Edward Archer or William Heberden. The page of Franklin&#39;s text reproduced [in Waife et al.] reminds us that the present-day problems of designing and evaluating clinical investigations are nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improved methods of variolation were introduced in the 1760’s, but the preliminary treatment was severe, the results were unpredictable, and a permanent reservoir of smallpox carriers was created. Search for a safer preventative measure therefore went on; the search culminated in Jenner’s vaccination, announced in 1798.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The short pamphlet in the Lilly Library is an important contribution to the movement that finally led to eradication of this dread disease” (Waife et al. 123).&lt;/p&gt;","smallpox; smallpox vaccine; vaccinia; vaccinology; viral vaccine","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens","","1904","&lt;p&gt;“Freud’s name and work became known to a wide public through this book, in which he showed that many of the small mistakes in speech and memory of normal people differ in degree rather than in kind from the abnormal behavior of the mentally ill. After graduating in medicine and working for some years at the General Hospital in Vienna, Freud (1856-1939) obtained a traveling scholarship that enabled him to visit Paris and study at the clinic of Charcot, the eminent French neurologist. On returning home in 1885, Freud became lecturer in neuropathology at the university and began his private practice in neurology, a specialty that then included psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Freud had been impressed by Charcot’s theory that hysteria was a thought disturbance rather than a disease of the nervous system and also was greatly influenced by his senior colleague, Josef Breuer, who had some success in relieving the symptoms of hysteria with hypnosis. These experiences stimulated Freud&#39;s interest in the subconscious mind and led to his method of ‘psychoanalysis,’ in which, by ‘free association,’ his patients unburden themselves of their repressed emotions and almost-forgotten thoughts. He made this discovery public in ‘Studies on Hysteria,’ written with Breuer in 1893, and explained his method in ‘Interpretation of Dreams’ (1900).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Freud built a theory about neurotic behavior and its origin in repressed erotic urges. To him, these were not necessarily physical and included normal love for parents, spouse, children, friends, and self. This new book of 1904, incorporating his ideas in an analysis of mistakes of speech he had observed in himself and in his friends and patients, led to the ‘Theory of Sexuality’ (1905), in which his chief conclusions were finally elaborated. Freud’s doctrines affected a liberalization of general attitudes toward mental and sexual abnormality, but his rejection of criticism and his intolerant insistence that he alone was right lessened his influence on medical psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The easy narrative style of ‘Psychopathology’ made it acceptable to a wide public. After writing about the almost universal forgetfulness of proper names, Freud went on to discuss other forms of verbal error such as substitution of words and speech, reading, and writing, and, through careful retracing of unconscious thought processes, related them to hidden memories or fears. He dealt similarly with mistaken impressions, neglected resolutions, and ‘unconscious’ acts and ended with a general chapter on determinism and on actions apparently influenced by chance or superstition” (Waife et al. 249).&lt;/p&gt;","behavioral sciences; psychology; psychopathology","Berlin, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

","","1914","&lt;p&gt;“The biochemist Casimir Funk (1884-1967), born in Poland and educated in Switzerland, Germany, and France, undertook to find the cause of beriberi while working at the Lister Institute in London. It had been recognized that a diet of polished rice would cause beriberi in humans and polyneuritis in pigeons. Using this animal model and starting with the assumption that a deficiency of amino acids was responsible for beriberi, Funk succeeded in isolating the protein factors in polished rice and rice polishings, only to discover that they had no curative effect on the birds. He persisted, pursuing the line that some other nitrogenous substance must be the antiberiberi factor he sought. Finally, he succeeded in isolating and crystallizing a potent compound that cured the neuritic birds and, it was later established, could prevent or cure human beriberi. This substance is now known as thiamine, or vitamin B1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After further investigation, Funk was able to differentiate the pellagra-preventing factor, niacin. For a paper published in the Journal of Physiology in 1912, he coined the term ‘vitamine-traction,’ later shortened to ‘vitamin.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Funk&#39;s book on vitamins was published in Germany when he was thirty. Prophetically calling his work ‘a first step in a new direction for physiology and pathology,’ he dealt in turn with Several diseases and showed them to be caused by a lack of essential foodstuffs. He described nutritional defects in infants and deficiency diseases in cattle and discussed the chemistry of growth and the role of the vitamins in growth and metabolism. His book opened the way for many advances in preventive and therapeutic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During World War I, Funk emigrated to the United States and worked in the laboratories of various hospitals in New York, including Cornell Medical College.

In a pharmaceutical laboratory in Paris, he began a study of sex hormones and was the first to detect and measure appreciable quantities of male hormone in the urine of men.

"Feldtbůch der Wundtartzney","","1517","&lt;p&gt;“Hans von Gersdorff, a native of Strassburg who lived around the beginning of the sixteenth century, wrote his surgery handbook on the basis of experience gained during forty years as a military surgeon. He was one of the first to discuss gunshot wounds and their treatment; unlike his contemporaries, he did not consider them to be poisonous. It was then common practice to aid removal of bullets by promoting suppuration, but von Gersdorff recommended probing for them with special instruments and then pouring hot oil into the wound. He used a tourniquet when amputating and, instead of cauterizing, checked hemorrhage with a styptic composed of vitriol, lime, alum, aloes, and nut galls. Finally, he enclosed the stump in ‘the bladder of a bull, ox, or hog.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His text is divided into four tracts. The first contains a summary of human anatomy based on old Arabic writings and the &lt;i&gt;Chirurgia Magna&lt;/i&gt; of Guy de Chauliac, physician to several of the fourteenth-century Avignon popes. Such knowledge of anatomy was needed by military surgeons, who had to cope with the extensive tissue and bone damage caused by the low-velocity firearms of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although most of the second tract deals with surgical treatment of wounds, two of its chapters concerned materia medica, including sedatives and analgesics. One preparation is a mixture of aromatic plant juices that, when inhaled preoperatively from a sponge, was said to produce sleep. Another herbal mixture was used following surgery to rouse the patient. The lists of many simples and composita used at the time make this book a forerunner of the dispensatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The third tract concerns leprosy. Although most of the text consists of prescriptions employed in its treatment, von Gersdorff did consider the relative merits of cautery in certain cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The concluding tract is composed of three Latin-German glossaries—one of anatomic terms, one of diseases, and one of simples (plant, animal, and mineral). Since many medicaments of the time had three or more different Latin names as well as more than one German synonym, this listing of equivalent terms must have filled a need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book was so popular that it went through twelve German editions between 1517 and 1606, was translated into Latin and Dutch, and was widely quoted, referred to, and plagiarized in subsequent medical texts. Eminently practical in its instructions on the care and treatment of the wounded, it had admirably graphic wood engravings.

"Anatomy of the Liver","","1654","&lt;p&gt;“Glisson’s treatise on the liver was the first book printed in England to give a detailed account, based on original research, of a single organ. Glisson (1597-1677) was associated with the ‘natural philosophers’ who founded the Royal Society in 1660, and he was also active among the physicians who wished to keep medical research within the College of Physicians, of which he was president from 1667 to 1669. He was regius professor of physic at Cambridge for forty years but practiced continuously in London, even during 1666—the year of the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His book on the liver is in Latin. There are ten chapters on general anatomy and forty-five on the liver, which give an admirable description of the gross anatomy of that organ. However, because microscopic study had scarcely begun and biochemistry was still to be born, his account of the liver’s function is necessarily primitive. The research was done twelve or more years before the book was published. Glisson recorded that he discovered the ‘common capsule,’ now named for him, while preparing a lecture in 1642. This ‘capsule of Glisson’ is the envelope of fibrous tissue that encloses the portal vein and hepatic artery (the two vessels carrying blood to the liver) and becomes continuous with the fibrous scaffolding of the whole organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Glisson made use of injection and casts and included a good engraving of a cast of the liver vessels. He also reported in detail his experiment to show the passage of the blood from the portal vein to the vena cava and demonstrated that the color of the liver derives from the contained blood. In the final chapters, he proved that the lymph flows, not to the liver, as had been taught, but from it and passes to the then recently discovered ‘common receptacle.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Four years earlier, Glisson had published the first clear description of infantile rickets, which was called ‘Glisson’s disease.’ Many years later, in his book on the stomach and intestines (1677), he demonstrated the mechanism of muscle contraction, substituting the theory of inherent ‘irritability’ for the prevalent idea of ‘vital spirits’” (Waife et al. 67).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy; hepatology; liver","London, England","","","","compound_object","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical","","1858","&lt;p&gt;“Gray (1825-1861) was thirty-three when he wrote his &lt;i&gt;Anatomy&lt;/i&gt;, which since then has been extensively revised and remains the standard handbook on this subject for English-speaking students. The work was superior to other treatises on anatomy in three areas—the lucid and logical arrangement of a mass of detailed description; clear new drawings based on dissections by the surgeon-author and the artist, a physician; and sections on The surgical anatomy of defined areas, such as the axilla, the elbow, the popliteal space, the perineum, and the laryngotracheal region. Even today, the book is considered a standard reference on anatomy; the thirtieth edition appeared in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gray was a surgeon who was engaged chiefly in anatomic research and teaching at St. George’s Hospital in London. He had published original studies on the ocular and auditory nerves, on the development of the retina and the labyrinth, and on the adrenals, the thyroid, the thymus, and the spleen. By discussing the embryologic development of these glands and classifying them as ductless, he laid a foundation for the specialty of endocrinology. He was awarded the triennial prizes of the Royal College of Surgeons for his research on the optic nerve and the spleen. Later, he became interested in pathology but unfortunately died of smallpox at the age of thirty-five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The physician artist who assisted Gray in his dissections was Henry Vandyke Carter.

"Chirurgia è Græco in Latinum conuersa","","1544","&lt;p&gt;“One year after the publication of Vesalius’s book on anatomy, Guido Guidi (1500?-1569), an Italian physician practicing in Paris, made an outstanding contribution to the literature of surgery. When summoned to Paris at the age of thirty-four by Francis I, king of France, who wished to spread the ‘new learning’ of the Italian Renaissance throughout his kingdom, Guidi brought with him a copy of an ancient Greek surgical manuscript as a gift for the king. Guidi’s medical and artistic background enabled him to appreciate the importance of this classical book with its illustrations of the manipulative operations devised by the Greek surgeons. Francis I appointed Guidi to organize the medical teaching in his new Collège de France, and under his patronage Guidi published his own Latin translation and commentary on the ancient Greek text, with the figures redrawn by skilled Italian artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His book is a splendid oversize volume that has been called ‘the most beautiful textbook of surgery printed in the sixteenth century’ with ‘woodcut illustrations [that] have never been equaled in this field.’ The full title, which may be translated as ‘Surgery Turned from Greek into Latin by Guido Guidi of Florence, Translator, with Some Commentaries by the Same Guidi,’ conceals the fact that the book provided contemporary Europeans with the best surgical treatises of the whole classical period. The text begins with the writings of Hippocrates on ulcers, fistulas, and wounds of the head and continues with Galen’s commentary on Hippocrates on fractures and joints. The large, clear woodcuts reconstruct ancient apparatus, showing a surgeon and his assistants reducing a dislocated shoulder, straightening a curved vertebral column on a special bed, and many similar procedures. These drawings were promptly copied by Ambroise Paré, the greatest surgeon of these decades, and often recopied. The book also contains Hippocratic views on the duties of a physician; Galen’s on bandaging, as illustrated by more than one hundred small figures; and those of Oribasius on ligatures and mechanical aids to surgery, with more large woodcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In dedication to Francis I, Guidi wrote: ‘Our surgeons cannot bandage properly, or fix suitable appliances to align broken bones, or treat wounds of the head adequately, because they lack the Greek authors who excelled in developing this part of medicine.’ Guidi returned to Italy, where he became professor of anatomy at Pisa, but the results of his research were published only in part and long after his death. The Latin form of his name, Vidus Vidius, is commemorated in the Vidian canal of the sphenoid bone, but the true monument to his influence is his book on surgery with its excellent illustrations” Guidi, Guido (Waife et al. 31).&lt;/p&gt;","fistula; general surgery; surgery, operative; ulcer","Paris, France","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Organon der rationellen Heilkunde","","1810","&lt;p&gt;“The reaction of a German physician against the abusive polypharmacy and the bleeding, purging, and vomiting of early nineteenth-century treatment initiated a counterrevolution in the form of homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hahnemann (1755-1843) practiced successfully in Dresden and Leipzig for only a short time before rejecting the current medical practices. During a period of brooding and study, he wondered why quinine cured the paroxysms of malaria. Upon taking the drug, he was promptly seized by a reaction similar to that of malaria patients;  after his wife and five children also reacted this way, he decided that quinine cured malaria by producing counterfeit disease. He evolved the concept of &lt;i&gt;similia similibus curantur&lt;/i&gt; (like should be cured by like) after several years of experimentation. According to this principle, a patient should be given a specific drug that would reproduce in a healthy individual the symptoms, or the clinical picture, of the disease under treatment. Hahnemann Introduce the new system publicly in 1796. His method stressed careful history-taking and the use of very small doses of single drugs in preference to overdosage with many. In the context of the practice of the day, it was a welcome improvement in therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His most important book, on ‘rational treatment’ (1810), had a considerable impact on medical practice. It naturally aroused the enmity of the apothecaries, who forced him to leave Leipzig in 1821.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He became rich and famous in time and, at the age of seventy-nine, married a wealthy woman who was forty-five years his junior. The couple moved to Paris, where Hahnemann developed a highly successful practice among the aristocracy. He continued to work until his death at the age of eighty-eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The concept of homeopathy spread rapidly in Europe and in the United States, where medical schools were established to teach this system. However, the introduction of pure chemicals and controlled animal experiments led to the establishment of more rational therapeutics and the rise of modern pharmacology” (Waife et al. 163).&lt;/p&gt;","homeopathy; therapeutics","Dresden, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Statical Essays: Containing Haemastaticks","","1733","&lt;p&gt;“It is an oddity in the history of medicine that Stephen Hales (1677-1761), who introduced quantitative methods into the study of the circulation of the blood, was a doctor not of medicine but of divinity. After taking holy orders, the Reverend Dr. Hales served as curate at Teddington, a small parish in Middlesex, until his death. However, his labors as ‘perpetual curate’ at St. Mary’s-in-the- Meadows were overshadowed by his achievements in physiology and botany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hales began his study of the circulation by measuring the blood pressure of experimental animals, such as horses and sheep; his manometer was a long glass tube, connected to the animal&#39;s carotid artery by means of the windpipe of a goose. The blood pressure was measured directly from the height of the blood in the glass column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hales measured the volume of the ventricle by making a cast of the cavity with wax; multiplying this volume by the pulse rate gave the cardiac output. He computed the circulation rate and the velocity of the blood in capillaries, veins, and arteries. With simple but ingenious experiments, he explored peripheral vascular resistance and the complex interplay of pressure, flow, and resistance. His work was the first real advance in circulatory physiology since Harvey’s pioneer observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hales was equally adept at botanic experiments, devising new techniques to measure the movement of sap in plants and trees. The results of these experiments were published in &lt;i&gt;Vegetable Staticks&lt;/i&gt; (1727). In 1733, after more than twenty years of experimentation, he consolidated the reports of his botanic experiments with those on the hemodynamics of the central and peripheral circulation (&lt;i&gt;Haemastaticks&lt;/i&gt;) in two volumes of &lt;i&gt;Statical Essays&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In later years, Hales became involved with the social aspects of medicine.

"Primae lineae physiologiae : in usum praelectionum academicarum","","1747","&lt;p&gt;“Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777) was professor of anatomy, medicine, surgery, and botany at the university of Göttingen in Hanover for seventeen years. Well known as an anatomist, botanist, and poet as well as writer, editor, and bibliographer, this remarkable man continued in public and academic service as well as with his research for a further twenty-four years after retiring to his native Switzerland, where he died at the age of sixty-nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The quantity of his writings and a record of the books he studied suggests that he must have read and written through every moment of his waking life. Yet he was a diligent dissector, traveler, collector, teacher, and administrator and kept up voluminous correspondence in several languages. He made original observations in the fields of anatomy and botany, wrote monographs in Latin, French, and German, and edited volumes of classical and contemporary medical writings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His most lasting gift to medicine was that of establishing experimental physiology as the basis for advances in medical knowledge. His most notable experiment was the demonstration that contractility is the property of muscle and sensibility the property of nervous tissue. He is sometimes considered the founder of modern neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A summary of his lectures, &lt;i&gt;Primae Lineae Physiologiae&lt;/i&gt;, was published in 1747. It was soon translated from Latin into English and other languages and later was revised and expanded several times by the author. The second edition (1751) is one hundred pages longer than the first, but the same arrangement of the contents was kept. Von Haller’s style is clear and lively. As briefly as possible and in a continuous descriptive style rather than a tabulation, he gives many facts, precisely detailed and concisely explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This introductory book was followed, between 1757 and 1766, by the eight volumes of his ‘Elements of the Physiology of the Human Body,’ which the French physiologist François Magendie, in 1827, called ‘that cursed book in which everything can be found.’ John F. Fulton, who like von Haller was both physiologist and bibliographer, characterized it as ‘a vast and well-systematized storehouse of physiological knowledge, replete with citation and an incredible number of accurate references to literature.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘First Lines’ is a small book, closely printed, comprising 857 numbered paragraphs and arranged in thirty-five chapters. Even today it provides a sound and intelligent guide for a beginner in physiology” (Waife et al. 115).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy; myology; nervous system; neurology; physiology","Göttingen, Germany","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

He had performed these studies by himself over a period of several years on many classes of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. He had become convinced of the truth of his conclusion several years before this book appeared; in the first chapter, he wrote that he had previously announced his opinion in lectures which the president and Fellows of the College of Physicians in London had attended and approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Harvey&#39;s book comprises, in seventy-two pages, an introduction and seventeen chapters. The introduction records some ‘manifest errors’ of current teaching on the arteries, pulmonary circulation, and heart structure, and in the first chapter Harvey gave his reasons for writing, acknowledging the work of Fracastoro and Fabricius. The book goes on to describe vividly the heart&#39;s expulsion of blood during systole, its passive refilling during diastole, and the filling of the arteries during systole. The heart&#39;s movement and function are presented in detail, together with experimental evidence that was derived from the dissection of mollusks, insects, and cold-blooded animals, in which the slow motions of the heart can be readily observed. Harvey also reported on the heart muscle’s ability to recover from fatigue. The account of the movement of the blood into the right heart from the vena cava, its passage through the lungs, and its arrival in the left ventricle establishes the reality of the pulmonary circulation and postulates the presence of invisible capillaries in the lungs. Harvey recounted his timed measurements of the volume of blood that returned to the heart and the amounts entering the aorta during systole. This was a major part of his evidence for the uninterrupted stream of the circulating blood. He admitted that the peripheral anastomoses of the arteries and veins were still to be clarified. The valves in the veins are correctly described and their function explained with records of his classic centripetal-flow experiments. Two illustrations are provided, reproducing four figures of the veins in the forearm, from Fabricius. The last chapter summarizes the whole argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Harvey’s clear reasoning from the observations and precise measurements made during his purposeful experiments supplied the key for advancing knowledge of physiology and was also a model for future scientific procedure” (Waife et al. 63).&lt;/p&gt;","blood circulation; cardiovascular system; physiology; respiratory system","Frankfurt, Germany","","","","compound_object","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

In 1851, he invented his “eye-mirror,” or ophthalmoscope, a tool of immense importance for the diagnosis of pathologic conditions in the eye, and introduced the device in this forty-nine-page booklet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In his monograph, von Helmholtz comments, ‘We need a source of light to observe sufficiently the part of the retina at which we look through the pupil, and we can see the background of the eye only through a refractive medium.’ The mechanism of the instrument is described and clarified by means of a diagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Von Helmholtz was thirty when he invented the ophthalmoscope. Four years earlier, he had presented his theoretical conclusions on the conservation of energy to the Physical Society of Berlin, and publication of his essay established the first law of thermodynamics. In 1852, using a pendulum-myograph he had invented, he measured the velocity of the nervous impulse; the mean of his observations was about thirty meters per second, a value accepted today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Von Helmholtz had been educated in Berlin as a surgeon for the Prussian army. He was of German, French, and English extraction; his mother was a direct descendant of William Penn. It was in the barracks laboratory at Potsdam, the city of his birth, that he conducted his research on the conservation of energy. At the age of twenty-nine, he was appointed professor of physiology and pathology at the University of Konigsberg. Later, he occupied the chairs of anatomy and physiology at Bonn and then the chair of physiology at Heidelberg. Finally, when he was fifty, he became professor of physics at Berlin, where he remained until his death. In his laboratory, Heinrich Hertz discovered the electro-physical principles that led to the development of wireless telegraphy, and Henry Augustus Rowland did the basic work on colloid chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Von Helmholtz never practiced ophthalmology or otolaryngology, but his ‘Handbook of Physiologic Optics’ (published in three parts between 1856 and 1867) has remained a permanent classic, and his study of the tympanum and ossicles of the middle ear contributed greatly to understanding of the phenomenon of audition. His &lt;i&gt;Tonempfindungen&lt;/i&gt; (‘Sensations of Tone’) (1863) dealt exhaustively with acoustics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although most of von Helmholtz’s later life was devoted to physics (and he is regarded as a giant in this field), he always remembered that he was a physician. ‘Medicine was once the intellectual home in which I grew up,’ he said, ‘and even the emigrant best understands and is best understood by his native land’” (Waife et al. 205).&lt;/p&gt;","ophthalmology; ophthalmoscopes","Berlin, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Hippocratis medici Sententiarum particula prima interprete Laurentio Laurentiano Florentino","","1494","&lt;p&gt;“Hippocrates (460-375 B.C.) was born on the Greek island of Cos, site of a temple of Aesculapius (Asklepios), the Greek god of medicine. According to the ancient biographers, his father, a teacher of medicine, provided him with his first training in the healing arts. Later, Hippocrates studied in Athens and then gained wide experience from practicing in cities throughout Macedonia, Thessaly, and Thrace. The writings attributed to him (though undoubtedly composed by many authors over a long period of time) were assembled two hundred years after his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long before the day of Hippocrates, followers of Aesculapius (mortal, god, and myth all in one) had taken the practice of medicine into the temples. Disease and its cure were associated with the wrath of the gods, divine miracles, and the interpretation and control of dreams. Hippocrates taught that disease is a physical disturbance attributable to or resulting in disorders in the bodily fluids. To detect these changes, Hippocrates and his followers recommended a careful history and a complete physical examination, with study of the patient by all the physician’s senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although Hippocrates paid homage to the past (the Hippocratic oath invokes Apollo, Aesculapius, Panacea, and ‘all the gods and goddesses’), it is to him that medicine owes the beginning of clinical observation and rational study of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whereas other physicians concealed their errors, Hippocrates advocated learning from one’s mistakes by frankly examining them and seeking their causes. His honesty, high ideals, and deep respect for his patients set Hippocrates apart from all earlier physicians. He has rightly come to be regarded as the ‘Father of Medicine,’ largely because he established the first rational school of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘Aphorisms’ are best known of the Hippocratic writings. The first aphorism has become a universal proverb: &lt;i&gt;Vita brevis: ars longo: occasio praeceps: experimentum fallax: iudicium difficile est&lt;/i&gt; (life is short, art long, opportunity fleeting, experiment dangerous, decision difficult). The rest of the aphorisms are more technical and record precise clinical observations only occasionally modified by traditional beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this book published in Florence in 1494, the aphorisms have accompanying notes by the translator Lorenzo Lorenzini, and then follows Galen’s commentary, similarly translated from Greek into Latin. The handsome volume in beautiful Florentine type, now a treasured rarity, thus includes the two most famous names in Greco-Roman medicine: Hippocrates, the earliest truly scientific physician, and Galen, the Greek from Pergamum, who practiced in Rome around A.D. 160 to 190, nearly six centuries after Hippocrates. Galen was considered the absolute master of medical knowledge for fifteen hundred years” (Waife et al. 13).&lt;/p&gt;","aphorisms and proverbs; ethics, pharmacy; ethics, medical; diagnosis; patient-centered care","Florence, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"The Care and Feeding of Children","","1894","“&lt;p&gt;Holt (1855-1924) exerted an outstanding influence on child health throughout America by his work at the Babies Hospital in New York, where he was physician from 1889 to 1923. At the suggestion of Mrs. Robert Chapin, a patroness of the hospital, he started a training school for nursemaids, providing a course of four to six months that led to a diploma. The basic teaching was described in his small book written for these students as well as for mothers and untrained children’s nurses. In it he discusses the differing nutritional needs of the newborn and older infants; the methods whereby cow’s milk should be pasteurized and modified to simulate human milk in its concentrations of carbohydrate, protein, and fat; and ways in which cereals and other foods should be introduced with and later given as substitutes for milk. The book achieved an unrivaled popular success and revolutionized child care in the United States. The field of pediatrics was never the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Holt was concerned with helping not merely the well-to-do. He campaigned successfully for a pure milk supply in New York City and spent nearly six years between 1890 and 1896 writing a masterly textbook on pediatrics, &lt;i&gt;The Diseases of Infants and Children&lt;/i&gt;, which remained the best of its kind through many editions and instructed several generations of pediatricians.

"The Natural History of the Human Teeth","","1778","&lt;p&gt;“John Hunter (1728-1793) was brought from Scotland to London as a rough, uncouth twenty-year-old to learn dissection at his brother William’s school of anatomy. John showed such a striking aptitude for the new activity that, within a year, he was demonstrating the art of dissection. Although he never had a traditional medical education, he began to study surgery at the age of twenty-three under William Cheselden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“John Hunter&#39;s superb background in comparative anatomy and pathology and his ability to relate structure to function made him one of England’s greatest surgeons and perhaps the founder of experimental surgery. Among his innovations was a technique for treating aneurysms without amputation by use of a single ligature to tie off the artery in the healthy tissue. He is said to have elevated surgery from an art to a science by showing that the proper route to the operating room led through the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a busy life devoted to research, teaching, and the practice of surgery, Hunter found time to study the structure, development, and diseases of the teeth and to collect and arrange a series of dental specimens. Hunter’s two treatises on the teeth rank him as one of the founders of modern scientific dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the first book (1771), Hunter classified the teeth in the system still used today and was the first to state definitely that the human teeth ‘are never more than thirty-two.’ He traced their development in the fetus and the child and established the structure of pulp, bone, and enamel. At the end of the book are descriptions of devices to correct malocclusion and even suggestions for a method of transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second volume (1778) dealt with pathology. Plus the diseases of the teeth, the alveolar processes, and the gums; abscesses; and nerve pains in the jaws. He concluded that tooth decay starts on the surface of the tooth and not in the interior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like his brother William, John founded a famous museum. Housing more than 13,000 specimens demonstrating comparative anatomy and the physiologic processes in animals and man, it was also a menagerie that contained numerous live mammals. After his death, the great Hunterian Museum became the property of the Royal College of Surgeons. It was partially destroyed by Nazi bombs in 1941.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“John Hunter was a student of Percivall Pott, a teacher of Edward Jenner, and with William Heberden, a consultant on an illness of Benjamin Franklin. Originally buried in St. Martins-in-the-Fields, his body was moved to Westminster Abbey sixty-six years after his death” (Waife et al. 131).&lt;/p&gt;","cuspid; bicuspid; dentition; malocclusion; molar; tooth","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Anatomia uteri humani gravidi...","","1774","&lt;p&gt;“As London’s foremost obstetrician, William Hunter (1718-1783) attended Queen Charlotte at the birth of each of her sixteen children. Hunter was an inspired teacher; his school of anatomy attracted men who became famous anatomists and surgeons. Among the latter was his brother John, who was ten years his junior. William Hunter’s home housed not only the school of anatomy but also a museum for his collections—books and manuscripts, paintings, coins, medals, and anatomic and pathologic specimens. These collections were later bequeathed to the University of Glasgow, where Hunter had studied for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hunter spent almost twenty-five years preparing &lt;i&gt;The Anatomy of the Gravid Human Uterus&lt;/i&gt;, the most magnificent obstetric atlas ever published. He engaged the best artists to draw and engrave the thirty-four illustrations, and it was printed by John Baskerville, the finest printer of the age, at the peak of his career. The life-size line engravings, many measuring 54 by 56 centimeters, achieve effects of depth and contrast without losing sharpness of detail and present a wide range of normal and pathologic conditions of the womb and fetus. Each page of text is printed in two columns, one in Latin and the other in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“William and his brother John explored the anatomy of the placenta and described the separate circulatory systems of the mother and the fetus. The brothers later quarreled over who should receive recognition for this work and separated professionally about three years before William’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“William Hunter was the first to describe retroversion of the uterus (1770). Outside the field of obstetrics, he is remembered for the first description of arteriovenous aneurysm and for clarifying the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatics. He was professor of anatomy in the Royal Academy and a Fellow of the Royal and Antiquarian societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hunter never married. A hardworking, disciplined man who lived simply and frugally, he was troubled by severe attacks of gout, a disease that also affected other members of his family. He died in 1783 at the age of sixty-four” (Waife et al. 133).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy; anatomy, regional; maternal health; reproductive health; uterine diseases; uterus","Birmingham, England","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"An inquiry into the causes and effects of the variolae vaccinae","","1798","&lt;p&gt;“Jenner (1749-1823) was nearly fifty when he published this slim book that brought a new understanding of the prevention of disease and had a profound influence on the future growth of medicine. For many years, Jenner had been a country practitioner and was respected by his local colleagues for his interest in heart disease and his skill in treating it. However, he was more widely known as a naturalist and was a Fellow of the Royal Society. Because he practiced for half the year at the fashionable spa of Cheltenham, influential London physicians referred their important patients to him there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It had long been claimed by farmers and dairymaids that a person who had an attack of cowpox would be immune against smallpox. Jenner was perhaps the first to give this matter serious study. He contended that inoculation with cowpox matter was a practical method of prophylaxis, simpler and safer than inoculation with the attenuated smallpox pus introduced in England in the 1720’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In his book Jenner advanced three points. First, he maintained that the protective ‘virus,’ which was found in horses, became safe for human inoculation only after it had been transmitted to cows. This confused theory he quietly dropped after longer experience. The next point was that only the ‘true virus’ gave protection and that ‘matter from other pustulous sores’ was ineffective. Lastly, he stated that vaccination gave permanent protection. He modified this opinion later and recommended revaccination in times of smallpox epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jenner supported these three contentions with twenty-three case histories in his book. The critical ones were those of Sarah Nelmes, the milkmaid from whose hand Jenner first took the cowpox virus, and a boy named James Phipps. In May, 1796, Jenner inoculated the eight-year-old James with ‘vaccinia,’ or cowpox material, and then with virulent smallpox pus to which, as Jenner anticipated, James did not react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other histories included those of a boy who was inoculated in 1798 with matter taken directly from the cow and of another inoculated with material from the arm of the first youth. From this second subject, inoculations were transferred to ‘several children and adults’ and thence to ‘several others,’ all of whom were protected from smallpox, as demonstrated by direct challenge. (Incidentally, the author recorded the first observed case of anaphylaxis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jenner’s book was issued three months after this successful venture, in June, 1798. There are four good plates in the book, three engravings of arms and one picture of the hand of Sarah Nelmes, showing the position and development of the cowpox pustules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the remaining twenty-four years of his life, Jenner campaigned actively for vaccination, writing pamphlets and articles and carrying on a worldwide correspondence. He lived to see vaccination generally accepted and successful in abolishing smallpox” (Waife et al. 151).&lt;/p&gt;","cowpox; smallpox; smallpox vaccine; vaccinia; vaccinology; viral vaccine","London, England","","","","compound_object","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"An inquiry into the causes and effects of the variolae vaccinae","","1798","&lt;p&gt;“Jenner (1749-1823) was nearly fifty when he published this slim book that brought a new understanding of the prevention of disease and had a profound influence on the future growth of medicine. For many years, Jenner had been a country practitioner and was respected by his local colleagues for his interest in heart disease and his skill in treating it. However, he was more widely known as a naturalist and was a Fellow of the Royal Society. Because he practiced for half the year at the fashionable spa of Cheltenham, influential London physicians referred their important patients to him there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It had long been claimed by farmers and dairymaids that a person who had an attack of cowpox would be immune against smallpox. Jenner was perhaps the first to give this matter serious study. He contended that inoculation with cowpox matter was a practical method of prophylaxis, simpler and safer than inoculation with the attenuated smallpox pus introduced in England in the 1720’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In his book Jenner advanced three points. First, he maintained that the protective ‘virus,’ which was found in horses, became safe for human inoculation only after it had been transmitted to cows. This confused theory he quietly dropped after longer experience. The next point was that only the ‘true virus’ gave protection and that ‘matter from other pustulous sores’ was ineffective. Lastly, he stated that vaccination gave permanent protection. He modified this opinion later and recommended revaccination in times of smallpox epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jenner supported these three contentions with twenty-three case histories in his book. The critical ones were those of Sarah Nelmes, the milkmaid from whose hand Jenner first took the cowpox virus, and a boy named James Phipps. In May, 1796, Jenner inoculated the eight-year-old James with ‘vaccinia,’ or cowpox material, and then with virulent smallpox pus to which, as Jenner anticipated, James did not react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other histories included those of a boy who was inoculated in 1798 with matter taken directly from the cow and of another inoculated with material from the arm of the first youth.

"In comincia el dignissimo Fasiculo de Medicina in Volgare . . .","","1493/94","&lt;p&gt;“This ‘little gathering’ (&lt;i&gt;Fasiculus Medicinae&lt;/i&gt;) of short treatises has been called ‘the first worthy medical text to be printed.’ Actually, it perpetuates traditional lore but exhibits better than any other book the conditions from which modern medicine arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Johannes de Ketham’ is the Latinized form of the name of Johann von Kircheim (?-1490?), who may have written these short guides for his students while he was a professor of medicine and surgery in Venice. Originally published in 1941 in Latin, this later edition is the first translation into the vernacular (Italian).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The treatises contain advice to physicians on conduct in medical practice, prognosis from urine, and techniques of bloodletting, obstetrics, and wound treatment as well as descriptions of common diseases. A paper by Pietro da Tussignano, on precautions against plague, has been included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each section of the book carries a traditional diagram: urine glasses arranged in a circle, relating to the influence of the four humors; a male figure marked with the sites for bloodletting; and drawings showing the parts of the body governed by constellations of the zodiac or afflicted by localized diseases ranging from quinsy to gout or by wounds made with various weapons. The treatise on obstetrics originally had a formalized drawing of a half-crouching pregnant woman (&lt;i&gt;Gravida&lt;/i&gt;). It was redrawn for later editions and was the first printed representation of the pelvic organs with a fetus &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt;, is those seen at dissection. This revision may have been influenced by Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s anatomic drawings. The book was translated and reprinted several times in the next thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Four new full-page illustrations were added in the Italian translation of 1493. Of majestic simplicity, these outline wood engravings have been attributed to artists of the school of Gentile Bellini. There are scenes of medical practice in the setting of fifteenth-century Venice. One is of a physician at his desk, with a man, an old woman, and a boy waiting to consult him. Another shows a consultation of five long-robed doctors attended by two youths carrying urine glasses. To illustrate the treatise on the plague, there is a sickroom where a physician holds a sponge over his nose and mouth as he feels a plague patient&#39;s pulse. The final picture depicts an anatomy lesson. The professor lectures while the demonstrator prepares to point out to a small audience the organs exposed by the bare-armed dissector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These formalized pictures and the text they illustrate provide the reader with some understanding of the haughty and rigid attitudes that must have prevailed during the fifteenth century among those who practiced medicine, surgery, and obstetrics. Flasks containing urine, for instance, were not touched by physicians but only by their assistance. The possession and use of books, these pictures seem to show, set medical practitioners apart from common men, who patiently awaited attention while the physician consulted his texts” (Waife et al. 17).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy; history, 15th century; humoralism; plague","Venice, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Italian","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Athanasii Kircheri e Soc. Iesv scrvtinivm physico-medicvm contagiosae luis, quae pestis dicitur . . .","","1658","&lt;p&gt;“Just as Galileo’s telescope revolutionized astronomy, so did the microscope open a window to the study of body tissues. Probably the first to employ the microscope in the investigation of disease was the Jesuit priest of Fulda, Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), contemporary with but slightly older than van Leeuwenhoek. This learned man was a virtuoso musician, orientalist, mathematician, and physicist and had some knowledge of medicine. His study of plague is valuable for its well-understood and carefully explained theory of &lt;i&gt;contagium vivum&lt;/i&gt; or the infection by living matter. In his &lt;i&gt;Scrutinium&lt;/i&gt;, published in Rome in 1658, he describes his studies on putrefaction, during which he saw maggots and other creatures develop in necrotic tissue. He found the blood of plague patients full of ‘little worms which propagate plague, so very small and unperceivable except with a very fine microscope.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This description occurs in the central section of his book, where he dealt with the ‘contagion or kindling of plague’ at some length. The earlier chapters discussed the causes and effects of plague, its prognosis, and the signs of its course, with some experiments on infected air. After the chapter on contagion, there is a thorough account of ‘therapeutics and prophylaxis, or the cure and preservation from contagion of the plague.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems unlikely that Kircher could have seen bacilli in the blood of plague patients with the simple low-power microscope available at the time. What he actually saw is less important than his realization of the association between disease and bacteria. Though he was probably wrong in identifying the objects under his crude microscope, his concepts led to a correct appreciation of the cause of infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The last twenty pages of his book provide a chronologic table of historic plague epidemics, including the Great Plague of Athens (430 B.C.) and the Black Death (A.D. 1350)” (Waife et al. 71).&lt;/p&gt;","bacterial infections; bacteriology; disease outbreaks; epidemics; microscopy; plague","Rome, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De l&#39;auscultation médiate, ou, Traité du diagnostic des maladies des poumons et du coeur, fondé principalement sur ce nouveau moyen d&#39;exploration","","1819","&lt;p&gt;“At the age of thirty-eight, Laënnec (1781-1826), a physician to the Hôpital Necker in Paris, provided the first adequate method for diagnosing diseases of the thorax. Matthew Baillie, the leading British physician of the time, wrote to him that his book was ‘the fullest and most able account of the diseased appearances of the Heart and Lungs which has yet been published.’ It enjoyed immediate international success, and in 1826, the year of his death, Laënnec brought out an expanded edition, giving more attention to pathology and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Auscultatory percussion, the evocation of sounds within the chest by tapping with the fingers, had been introduced by Auenbrugger nearly fifty years earlier but spread only slowly into practice until 1806, when Corvisart, Laënnec’s teacher, began to advocate its use. Laënnec’s innovation was the stethoscope, an instrument for ‘indirect auscultation’ through amplification of the chest sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In its four parts, the book deals with exploration of the voice and the diagnosis of phthisis; study of the respiratory organs, pneumonia, emphysema, pleurisy, and pneumothorax; the bronchial sounds; and investigation of the circulation, including analysis of the heart sounds, diseases of the heart, and aneurysm of the aorta. The illustrations on four double plates show Laënnec’s newly invented stethoscope, pathologic conditions of the lung, and deformity of the chest from chronic latent pleurisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Laënnec also wrote numerous works on other medical subjects, including treatises on peritonitis, the capsule of the liver, and pathologic anatomy, especially that type of liver cirrhosis which has been named for him. He added significantly to the knowledge of pathology with his method of correlating clinical observations with postmortem findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His abiding interest, however, was the diagnosis of diseases of the chest, a preoccupation quite possibly attributable to the fact that his mother had died of tuberculosis when he was a very small child. This heritage, along with a frail constitution and close association with pulmonary disease patients, led, ironically, to his own death from tuberculosis at the age of forty-five” (Waife et al. 173).&lt;/p&gt;","auscultation; diagnosis; diagnostic techniques, cardiovascular; heart auscultation; heart diseases; lung diseases; percussion; stethoscopes","Paris, France","","","","image/jpg","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Lancisi responded with the treatise &lt;i&gt;De Subtaneis Mortibus&lt;/i&gt; (‘On Sudden Death’), published in 1707. In the first half of the book he dealt with sudden death in general, attributing it to three causes—‘suffocation from intemperance,’ syncope, and apoplexy. More important, however, were the sections on heart disease, because here Lancisi laid the foundations of cardiac pathology. He described such conditions as cardiac syphilis, which had not previously been identified, and provided a classification of heart disease. Hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart were presented as manifestations of cardiac disease, and the existence of valvular vegetations was discussed for the first time. Lancisi’s observations on heart disease were based on cases he had seen in his practice in Rome and include reports of autopsies in five fatal cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lancisi died in 1720, but his later researches on the heart, with an important treatise on aneurysm, were published in 1728 by his former assistant, Francesco Soldati. In that book, the frequency of aneurysms of the heart was noted. Lancisi pointed out that the walls of some aneurysms are thin, whereas those of others are thick. Their causes, he stated, are diverse and include heredity, syphilis, asthma, palpitation, excesses, and violent emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lancisi had been much interested in epidemiology and possessed a clear insight into contagion not shared by his contemporaries. His book on the ‘Poisonous Effluvia of the Marshes’ (1717), which described the Italian epidemic of malaria that had occurred in 1715, suggested that mosquitoes might be responsible for the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lancisi’s considerable scholarship was further recognized when Clement XI asked him to edit the anatomic plates which Eustachio (q.v.) had executed in 1552 but which had been lost for 162 years.

"De Pulmonibus Observationes Anatomicae","","1663","&lt;p&gt;“Malpighi (1628-1694), the founder of histology, was physician to Pope Innocent XII and professor of anatomy at Bologna, Pisa, and Messina. He was remarkable for the range of his research in comparative anatomy, embryology, and physiology and for his innovative studies of plant tissues. His most original contribution to medicine is contained in his &lt;i&gt;De Pulmonibus,&lt;/i&gt; or ‘On the Lungs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That work, originally published in 1661 as a pamphlet of twenty-three pages, is exceedingly rare. Written in the form of two letters to G. A. Borelli, his colleague at Pisa, it was reissued in 1663 in book form with Bartholin’s &lt;i&gt;De Pulmonum&lt;/i&gt;. In the first letter, Malpighi showed that the pulmonary tissues are vesicular and that the trachea ends in bronchial filaments; this supplied the anatomic basis for respiratory exchange in the lungs. The second letter recorded his discovery of the capillary link between the arteries and the veins, which complemented Harvey&#39;s experiments and theory on the circulation of the blood. Malpighi later described the red blood cells as ‘fat globules looking like a rosary of red coral.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another book, on the viscera, was first issued in 1666 as three essays—on the liver, the cerebral cortex, and the kidneys. Later in the same year, two more essays were added, on cardiac polyp and on the spleen. All of them are notable for their original descriptions of histologic structure, in which Malpighi was a pioneer. Here, Malpighi elaborated Lorenzo Bellini’s account of the uriniferous tubules and noted that the glomeruli are attached to the tips of the arterial branches, which have been called the ‘Malpighian bodies.’ His name has also been applied eponymically to the Malpighian bodies of the spleen and the Malpighian layer of the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His later studies on embryology and plant physiology, though carried out in Italy, were encouraged by the Royal Society of London, which also published most of his work. The illustrations in &lt;i&gt;De Formatione Pulli in Ovo&lt;/i&gt; (1673) and &lt;i&gt;De Ovo Incubato&lt;/i&gt; make him the founder of modern descriptive embryology. Better than those of all other contemporary embryologists, his detailed observations were also the first accurate reports of the development of the aortic arches, the head fold, the neural groove, and the cerebral and optic vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gentle, fair-minded man’s life was marred by the personal attacks of his former colleague Borelli and by a long-standing feud between his family and a neighboring clan. Some of his major work was destroyed in manuscript form and never rewritten” (Waife et al. 73).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, regional; diagnosis; lung diseases; respiratory system","Copenhagen, Denmark","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie","","1842","&lt;p&gt;“Von Liebig (1803-1873) became professor of chemistry at Giessen in 1825 when he was only twenty-two. He had studied first at the University of Bonn, then earned his Ph.D. at Elangen, and continued his studies under Gay-Lussac in Paris. A pioneer in laboratory teaching and agricultural chemistry, he made his reputation as a pure chemist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1825, Germany lagged behind other European countries in the field of chemistry. Von Liebig, by creating the first teaching laboratory, inaugurated Germany’s era of brilliant chemical research. He became interested in the application of chemistry to agriculture and tried to introduce scientifically compounded fertilizers to replace local empirical methods of improving the soil. He was the first to suggest that overuse of the soil depleted its nutrients and that they should be replaced by nonorganic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His interest later extended to medical needs, and he became the first modern chemist to apply the specialized techniques of organic chemistry to physiology, pathology, and pharmacy. He studied many reactions, including the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats and the degradation of proteins and purines to urea, uric acid, and hippuric acid. Paradoxically, despite von Liebig’s inventive nature, he also was a conservative who could not accept Schwann’s demonstration of living cells in yeast and the biotic cause of putrefaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Von Liebig wrote ‘Organic Chemistry in Its Application to Physiology and Pathology’ at the age of thirty-nine. The treatise was dedicated to the doyen of contemporary chemists, the Swedish scientist John Jacob Berzelius, although Berzelius had criticized him severely. It contains three main sections; the chemical process of respiration and nutrition; the metamorphosis of forms, which carries as a running title on each page, ‘The Chemical Process of the Change of Forms’; and the phenomena of movement in animal organisms, followed by discourses on the theories of disease and of respiration. The medical value of the book, beyond its somewhat theoretical formulation, consists in the clear explanation of the chemical process in respiration (including the importance of oxygen), the introduction of the concept of metabolism, with a classification of the organic foodstuffs. With these three sections, von Liebig laid the foundation of subsequent biochemical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Von Liebig’s resistance to the new living-cell theory and his conviction that all biologic processes could be explained as chemical reactions led him into some erroneous deductions, but his factual observations had lasting validity” (Waife et al. 197).&lt;/p&gt;","chemistry, organic; metabolism; physiology","Braunschweig, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"A Treatise of the Scurvy","","1753","&lt;p&gt;“James Lind (1716-1794), a Scottish-trained surgeon, began his reforms in naval hygiene with this treatise on scurvy. The work was not entirely original, because the clinical nature of the disease and the preventive properties of fresh fruits and vegetables had been explored by Lind’s predecessors. Nevertheless, his practical suggestions for including antiscorbutic foods in sailors’ daily menu8s during long sea voyages exerted a tremendous influence. His statements about the cause and cure of scurvy were not confirmed and elucidated until the early twentieth century, when the effects of vitamin C deficiency were precisely defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While serving at sea as a surgeon’s mate in 1747, Lind carried out a controlled experiment on the diet of the sailors. Perhaps the first clinical trial, the study showed that citrus juice could prevent and cure scurvy. Six years later, after he had received a medical degree from the University of Edinburgh, Lind published this book. It presented a critical account of current opinion, demonstrating that the disease is not congenital, hereditary, or infectious; a description of the disease, its cause, prevention, and cure; and a digest of everything previously written about scurvy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The treatise describes Lind’s experiment. Each of six pairs of patients was given one of the following dietary supplements: cider, ‘elixir vitriol,’ vinegar, seawater, oranges and lemons, and ‘an electuary of garlic, mustard seed, radish, Peru balsam, and gum myrrh’ with garlic water. All other conditions were kept constant. In comparing the results, Lind found ‘sudden and visible effects from the use of the oranges and lemons.’ The tender sprouting tops of green wheat also served to protect men against scurvy, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, Lind observed that cartilaginous prominences, especially those of the ribs and the knees, were the parts most noticeably affected by scurvy. These effects were seen as pain and swelling during the course of the disease and by abnormalities at autopsy. More than one hundred and fifty years later, it was shown that ascorbic acid is necessary to maintain the production and integrity of collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lind’s classic, well-controlled clinical trial offered firm support to previous recommendations that citrus juice be given to prevent scurvy. Convinced by Lind’s work, Captain James Cook included citrus juice in the diet of the sailors on his South Sea voyage of 1772-1775 and reported its unprecedented success to the Royal Society in 1776. In spite of this support, the use of citrus juice was not officially adopted by the British navy until forty years after the publication of Lind’s treatise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lind also fought for the establishment of hospital ships, cleanliness and ventilation in sick bays, and other measures for which he had been called the ‘father of nautical hygiene’” (Waife et al. 119).&lt;/p&gt;","ascorbic acid; deficiency diseases; malnutrition;  scurvy; vascular diseases","Edinburgh, England","","","","compound_object","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Tractatus de Corde. Item de Motu et Colore Sanguinis et Chyli in eum Transitu","","1669","&lt;p&gt;“Richard Lower (1631-1691), a native of Cornwall, belonged to the group of young Oxford scientist led by Robert Boyle and Thomas Willis. From the time he took his arts degrees in 1655, he collaborated in the dissections on which Willis based his book on the brain, published in 1664. Lower was the first man to effect the intravenous transfusion of the blood (through a quill cannula) from one animal to another. The first human transfusion was performed by J. B. Denys in Paris in 1667, two years later; shortly after that, Lower made the first one in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He received his medical degree in 1665 and moved to London, where he carried out physiologic research, was active as a member of the Royal Society, and practiced with great success as a physician. He tried to explain the function of anatomic structures through his experiments and, in dissecting the cardiovascular system, made significant observations that virtually completed Harvey&#39;s work on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His book, &lt;i&gt;Tractatus de Corde&lt;/i&gt;, is in five sections: the site and structure of the heart, its movements, the movements and colors of the blood, blood transfusion, and the chyle and its transition and transmutation into blood. Lower’s most original contributions, recorded in the book, were his concept of the heart muscle and his explanation of the heartbeat as a muscular mechanism, his description of the change in color of the blood from dark to bright as it passes through the lungs, and his conclusion that this was caused by the absorption of air. Soon after the observation, John Mayow, another Cornishman, made the correct observation that only part of the inspired air is absorbed by venous blood in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a second edition, in 1670, Lower incorporated a chapter, ‘De Catarrhis,’ in which he showed that catarrh does not come from the pituitary, as had been believed, but is secreted in the respiratory passages of the nose and sinuses. It was courageous of him to oppose the traditional Galenic belief that even Vesalius had upheld. This discovery ended the practice of ‘purging the brain’” (Waife et al. 87).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, regional; blood circulation; blood transufion; circulatory physiological phenomena; coronary circulation; physiology","London, England","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

In 1879, he successfully evacuated and excised a hematoma of the brain, and, in a third case, he removed a tumor from the dura mater and another from under it. This was almost certainly a meningioma. By the time of Sir Rickman John Godlee’s widely noted excision of a brain tumor in London in November, 1884, Macewen had successfully treated a series of no fewer than 7 neurologic cases by surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before this book was published, he was already well known for his improved treatment of aneurysm, his radical method of curing oblique inguinal hernia, and his use of osteotomy for genu valgum, and he had made successful transplantations of bone.

"Diseases of the Heart","","1908","&lt;p&gt;“Sir James Mackenzie (1853-1925), one of the giants of cardiology, was perhaps unique among the scientists represented in this collection, because he practiced general medicine and surgery for twenty-five years in a small English village and simultaneously carried out some highly significant clinical and experimental research. He had received his M.D. from the University of Edinburgh and spent a year as a house physician before going into practice. Mackenzie was essentially a self-taught investigator. Despite his isolation from the medical research community, he did original work in differentiating cardiac arrhythmias, pioneered in making devices for recording pulse waves, and reported his findings in the scientific literature. He first described his graphic recording instruments in 1892 and published a major treatise, &lt;i&gt;The Study of the Pulse&lt;/i&gt;, in 1902. He moved to London at the age of fifty-four and the next year (1908) published Diseases of the Heart. Soon he became internationally famous as an outstanding clinician, teacher, and researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This large volume, comprising thirty-five chapters and four appendices, summed up his work. Mackenzie pointed out that his approach had been essentially clinical and that the pathology needed more exhaustive study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book is logically arranged. After a general survey of the developmental, anatomic, and physiologic background (including that of the muscle cells), Mackenzie dealt with examination of the patient, giving details of special symptoms. He described his own instruments for simultaneously recording the arterial pulse at the wrist and the jugular pulse in the neck and for studying arterial pressure and the condition of the liver. Many of his historic tracings of abnormal pulse waves are reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mackenzie explained the heart’s action and the varieties of irregular function, particularly his concept of ‘nodal rhythm,’ which later was termed ‘auricular fibrillation.’ An appendix to this discussion recorded his observations on ‘contraction starting at a place other than the normal.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chapters are also devoted to secondary alterations in heart function (for example, those in acute febrile disorders) and to other special aspects of heart disease. In addition, he described valvular defects, such as mitral stenosis. Recognition of this defect led to successful surgical treatment half a century later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Toward the end of his life, Mackenzie resumed general practice in Scotland, where, to help young physicians, he established the Institute for Clinical Research at St. Andrews. In recognition of his achievements, he received a knighthood and many other honors.

Separate prints of his article are now excessively rare, but the description of his apparatus was included in ‘Medical Physiology of the Circulation of the Blood’ (&lt;i&gt;Physiologie médicale de la circulation du sang&lt;/i&gt;), published in 1863 when he was thirty-three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marey is remembered also for discovering the cardiovascular reflex that has been named for him. And explaining the reflex, he stated that the heart rate is inversely proportional to the blood pressure in the arch of the aorta and in the carotid sinus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This book was, he wrote, ‘an attempt to determine the influence of respiration on blood pressure and flow, reconciling the opinions of Ludwig and Vierodt, since opposite effects can be produced by respiration according to the state of the lungs.’ He described ‘apparatus and experiments for recording the heart movements,’ including his cardiograph and his sphygmograph, which was an improvement on Vierodt’s instrument. He also supplied much new information about the distribution of heat by the circulating blood, with an explanation of the equilibrium of body temperature. He reported on changes of color and temperature in the superficial organs, showed that the pulse varies according to the arterial tension, and discussed changes of frequency in the heartbeat, claiming that improved methods of diagnosing vascular disease were provided by his research, in which he made experimental heart lesions and animals and artificial working models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book includes the first graphic records of the pulse, and for it Marey was awarded a medical prize in 1864 by the Academy of Sciences. He published another large book on circulation in 1881 but meanwhile became more interested in animal movement (&lt;i&gt;La Circulation du sang à l’état physiologique et dans les maladies&lt;/i&gt;), on which he wrote three important monographs in 1867, 1873, and 1894” (Waife et al. 221).&lt;/p&gt;","baroreflex; blood pressure; blood flow velocity; circulatory and respiratory physiological phenomena; hemodynamics; vascular resistance","Paris, France","","","","image/jpg","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De sermonum proprietate, sive Opus de universo","","1467","&lt;p&gt;“Hrabanus Magnentius (776-856) was born of a noble family in Mainz at the end of the dark ages. He was a pupil of the famous Alcuin at Tours, where he adopted the name Maurus (a favorite disciple of St. Benedict). Later in life he became abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Fulda in Thuringia, Germany. Thanks to Maurus, Fulda achieved fame as a school where long-forgotten classical texts were copied, translated, and studied. Shortly before his death, Maurus became archbishop of Mainz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hrabanus Maurus is regarded as one of the first medieval Scholastics. The term ‘philosophy’ was beginning to be applied to disparate aggregate of learning that was being rediscovered from the writings of classical antiquity. Thus, the period marked a cautious beginning of the great debate between reason and religious dogma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maurus’ universal knowledge was renowned. In German lands, he became the leader of the first renaissance of art and learning in the western world under the Emperor Charlemagne. He is now remembered chiefly for his encyclopedic dictionary, &lt;i&gt;De Sermonum Proprietate&lt;/i&gt; (c. 800), which contains one short chapter on medicine, then considered an element of philosophy. Six hundred years later, it was the first encyclopedia to be printed. It consists of twenty-two ‘books,’ or essays, combining some classical lore, moralizing, and theological doctrine, on a variety of topics. There are books on man and animals; countries and the world; water and the sea; earth and its composition; magic; stones and metals; measures, weights, and numbers; music; and drugs. Maurus’s work is bound with, and follows, &lt;i&gt;Concordantia Evangelistarum&lt;/i&gt;, by Zacharius Chrysopolitanus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The section on medicine and diseases occupies only two pages and is a sermon on the subject rather than a factual treatment. It purports to define the physician&#39;s art, health, and sickness according to the four humors. It is interspersed with numerous quotations from the Bible and contains many generalizations, such as ‘health is bodily integrity and temperance,’ ‘immoderation brings danger,’ and ‘debility of body is debility of mind, as we read in the Book of Leviticus.’ Leprosy (the main disease discussed) is called a punishment for the spiritual blindness and deafness of heresy and blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By 1647, when the encyclopedia was printed, Maurus’s ideas had become antiquated. Medicine had made great advances in the later Middle Ages and was progressing even more rapidly in the beginning renaissance of science. Nevertheless, the early printers preferred such texts as this, which were famous and traditional rather than innovative, in view no doubt of their largely clerical clientele” (Waife et al. 15).&lt;/p&gt;","humoralism; medicine in literature; philosophy, medical","Strasbourg, France","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Tractatus quinque medico-physici","","1674","&lt;p&gt;“John Mayow (1641?-1679) as a young Oxford lawyer became interested in physics and medicine through the influence of Robert Boyle and his circle. Although there is no record of his having gained a medical degree, he studied physics and practiced medicine in London and in Bath and was familiar with Malpighi’s work. At twenty-seven, he published a small book, ‘Two Treatises on Respiration and on Rickets,’ in Latin. The second edition was ‘Five Treatises,’ containing the original two along with additional papers on ‘Aërial Spirits of Nitre,’ ‘Respiration of the Foetus,’ and ‘Muscular Motion and Animal Spirits.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The early essay on respiration is the most important of Mayow’s writings, for he demonstrated the part played by movement of the ribs in respiration; he first noted the double articulation of the ribs with the spine and the arrangement of the intercostal muscles that control the movement of the thoracic cage. He also observed that blood changes in color from blue to red during its passage through the lungs. He ascribed this change quite correctly to the taking up by the blood of a certain portion of the air, which he called the ‘igneo-aerial particles’ of the ‘aërial spirits of nitre.’ Mayow, it seems, had an intuitive understanding of the gaseous interchange that occurs during respiration between blood and the inspired air. Thus, he was very close to the discovery of oxygen. He may have owed the concept to Boyle but was certainly the first to demonstrate it by ingenious experiments. The identification and isolation of oxygen had to wait for Priestley and Lavoisier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mayow showed also that animal heat is generated in the muscles themselves and realized that the maternal blood, besides nourishing the fetus, gives it ‘aërial spirits of nitre’ through the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mayow was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1678. He died the next year, still a young man. It is unfortunate that his writings, which were in Latin, were so unskillfully translated for the Royal Society that the English version could not be properly understood and hence was disregarded” (Waife et al. 83).&lt;/p&gt;","circulatory and respiratory physiological phenomena; observation; oxygen saturation; respiration","Oxford, England","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Mémoire sur la découverte du magnétisme animal . . .","","1779","&lt;p&gt;“Mesmer’s magnetotherapy, though without scientific foundation, evoked such excitement in the late eighteenth century that his name endured since then in the term ‘mesmerism.’ A native of Switzerland, Mesmer (1734-1815) studied medicine in Vienna under van Swieten and de Haen. His graduating thesis proposed the theory that heavenly bodies act upon living beings by means of a subtle fluid he called ‘animal magnetism.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mesmer came to believe in the therapeutic efficacy of iron magnets placed on the patient’s body or passed over it. During 1773 and 1774, while practicing as a physician in Vienna, he claimed that he had ‘cured’ some hysterical patients. He had done this, he explained, by utilizing the flux and reflux of magnetic currents in the body under the influence of hypnotic suggestion. In experimenting with magnets, he conceived the idea that similar power is possessed by the human hand. Anton Stoerck, the chief physician in Vienna, refused to believe Mesmer’s claims, and in 1777 Mesmer was ordered to discontinue this form of treatment and leave the city. He moved to Paris in 1778 and there erected a temple to the god of health, where, with a background of soft music, the purple-clad Mesmer would hold hypnotic seances, waving a magnetized wand. Although the afflicted thronged to his temple and his activities became a sensation, a commission was finally appointed to investigate the phenomenon. Among the examiners were Benjamin Franklin and Antoine Lavoisier. The commission decided that magnetism was due to the imagination, Mesmer’s claims were denounced, and the clinic was suppressed in 1784.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In self-justification, Mesmer published the book &lt;i&gt;Mémoire sur la découverte du magnétisme animal&lt;/i&gt; in 1779. After an ‘Advice to the Public’ in his own favor, Mesmer records the case histories of the patients he had treated successfully in Vienna, with some account of his controversies. Twenty-seven theoretical ‘Propositions’ follow and provide a pseudoscientific basis for his treatment. These include statements that there is ‘a universal fluid susceptible of receiving, propagating, and communicating the impression of movement,’ although ‘up to the present its laws are unknown,’ that there are a ‘flux and reflux’ of this fluid in animal bodies, and that ‘I call this property of the animal body, which is analogous to the properties of the magnet, Animal Magnetism.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mesmer’s work had minimum medical value in itself, but it seems clear that in retrospect he was curing psychosomatic ailments by suggestion. Ultimately, ‘mesmerism’ stimulated research on nerve impulses and influenced the rise of psychotherapy” (Waife et al. 135).&lt;/p&gt;","animal magnetism; magnetic fields; placebo effect; pseudoscience","Geneva, Switzerland","","","","image/jpg","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Leçons sur la pathologie comparée de l&#39;inflammation, Faites à l&#39;Institut Pasteur in 1891 ","","1892","&lt;p&gt;“Metchnikoff (1845-1916), born in Russia and trained as a zoologist, will always be identified with the fields of inflammation and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘One day when the whole family had gone to a circus to see some extraordinary performing apes,’ he wrote, ‘I remained alone with my microscope, observing the life in the mobile cells of transparent star-fish larva. . . .It struck me that similar cells might serve in the defense of the organism against intruders. . . .if my supposition was true, a splinter introduced into the body of the star-fish larva, devoid of blood-vessels or of a nervous system, should soon be surrounded by mobile cells as is to be observed in a man who runs a splinter into his finger. . . .I fetched. . . .a few rose thorns and introduced them at once under the skin of some beautiful star-fish larvae as transparent as water. . . .Very early the next morning I ascertained that it fully succeeded.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From this beginning, he went on to show that dilatation of the circulatory bed and an inflamed part of the body is a secondary rather than a primary event and that the basic cause of inflammation is the conflict between invading organisms and the mobile or fixed phagocytic cells of the mesoderm which are concerned with defense. Immunity, he suggested, fails wherever local or general conditions within the body impair or prevent this phagocytic response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1891, after ten years of research, Elie Metchnikoff expounded his theory of phagocytosis in a series of lectures. They were published as a book in French and in Russian the next year and translated into English by the eminent physiologist E. H. Starling in 1893. The work begins with a statement, ‘Infection is a conflict of organisms for whose understanding a study of comparative pathology is essential.’ Metchnikoff traced intracellular digestion through the animal Kingdom from unicellular forms to vertebrates, showing the phagocytic role of the leukocytes and the evolution of inflammation. He discussed chronic inflammation (with tuberculosis as its type), serous inflammation, and the antitoxic property of serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although the concept of immunity had been intuitively grasped by earlier works from Jenner to Pasteur, the new science of immunology was launched with Metchnikoff’s ‘Immunity in Infective Diseases,’ published in 1901. For his contributions, he was awarded many honors from around the world, including the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 1908, which he shared with Paul Ehrlich, the German bacteriologist” (Waife et al. 245)&lt;/p&gt;","immunity; inflammation; microbiology; microscopy; phagocytosis ","Paris, France","","","","image/jpg","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Dos libros, el uno que trata de todas las cosas que traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales : que sirven al uso de la medicina, y el otro que trata de la Piedra Bezaar, y de la Yerva Escuerçonera","","1569","&lt;p&gt;“Nicolás Monardes (1493-1588) belonged to an Italian family established in business in Seville, the city in southern Spain most involved in trade with ‘New Spain’ in the Americas. An imaginative entrepreneur as well as a physician, he was the first to introduce the herbal products of Central America to the pharmacopeias of Europe. Although he never left Seville, Monardes obtained specimens of all plants imported from Central America and established a museum for them. Part of it was a botanical garden in which he managed to cultivate every plant that had been brought to him from the New World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Monardes was the first physician to write about the arrow poison curare and about tobacco, which the West Indians used medicinally. He imported tobacco in 1558 and was growing it in his garden in Spain while Sir Walter Raleigh was still a child in England. Monardes first described these drugs in 1565 in &lt;i&gt;Historia medicinal que trata de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias occidentales&lt;/i&gt;. The book was then expanded and published in three sections, of which the Lilly collection contains the first. Its subtitle anticipates the second volume and reads (in translation): ‘Two Books. One deals with all things brought from our West Indies which can be used in medicine, and the other deals with the bezoar stone and scorzonera grass.’ A third section was published in 1574, and three years later all three parts appeared in an English translation entitled &lt;i&gt;Joyfull Newes Out of the New-founde Worlde&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Monardes recorded many native Indian plant names. He described the sacred wood guaiacum, thought to be a cure for syphilis; chinaroot and its cognate, sarsaparilla; and, more particularly, the purgative ‘white rhubarb.’ His second volume made a special impact on Europe because of its account of tobacco. He tells of its various medicinal uses—as a treatment for toothache and carbuncles and as an antidote for some types of poison. ‘Some time ago,’ he wrote, ‘some Caribbean Indians set out in canoes for San Juan de Puerto Rico . . . and they came to a plantation and killed a few Indians and Spaniards and wounded many. Since the foreigners did not have corrosive sublimate to cure them, it was decided to treat them with tobacco juice . . . and God willed that . . . the pains, ravings and fainting spells, from which they used to die, were relieved. Thus the power of the poison was removed . . . and the islanders, being acquainted with this cure, are now using it for wounds received when fighting the Caribs. And they are no longer afraid, for they have found such a great remedy for such a desperate menace” (Waife et al. 43).&lt;/p&gt;","materia medica; medicine, traditional; phytotherapy; therapeutics","Seville, Spain","","","","image/jpg","Spanish","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De sedibus, et causis morborum per anatomen indagatis libri quinque . . .","","1761","&lt;p&gt;“Morgagni (1682-1771), professor at Padua for sixty years, was a renowned man of medicine in Europe in the mid-eighteenth century. In fame and achievement, he was rivaled only by Boerhaave at the beginning of his career and by von Haller in his later years. Because Venice was at that time the most frequented city in Europe and the university town of Padua was nearby, Morgagni was accessible for consultation to a great number of patients. His earlier anatomic work appeared in the six series of letters of his &lt;i&gt;Adverseria Anatomica&lt;/i&gt; 1706 and 1719. During the 1720’s, he published another series of letters commenting on the ancient Roman medical texts. He also edited the works of his master, Valsalva, with an elaborate commentary (published in 1740) running to more than a thousand pages, six times longer than the Valsalva material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Morgagni’s ‘Five Books on the Seats and Causes of Diseases Investigated by Anatomy, Comprising Almost Innumerable Dissections and Observations Now First Published for the Benefit of Physicians, Surgeons, and Anatomists’ is considered one of the great books in the history of medicine. Issued in Venice when he was seventy-nine, it appeared in two volumes and ran to some 850 tall pages with double columns of print. As though to guarantee acceptance throughout the learned world, each of the five ‘books’ is dedicated to a prominent physician or surgeon in a different city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Morgagni’s hundreds of case histories are correlated with necropsy reports in such a simple and attractive style that his vast collection remains one of the most readable of all medical books. The reports are replete with astute observations, and, in many cases, Morgagni described conditions that were not generally recognized until decades later. Especially noteworthy our discussions of cardiac valves (aortic insufficiency, mitral stenosis), syphilitic aneurysm, pneumonia, and tuberculosis of the kidney. A number of eponyms have kept his name familiar to future generations; certain crypts, foramens, tubercles, sinuses, valves, columns, and other structures are associated with Morgagni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This monumental work may be said to establish the organ concept of disease and to make pathologic anatomy a major medical discipline. By coincidence, the book was published the same year as Auenbrugger’s major contribution on percussion. The age of observation had arrived” (Waife et al. 125).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, regional; pathological conditions, anatomy; cardiovascular system; musculoskeletal; gastrointestinal system; nervous system; pathology; respiratory system ","Venice, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

His work was called by the eminent English physician Arthur Hurst ‘as much a piece of original research as the discovery of a new element or a new star, and equally deserving of recognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The various chapters of the book pertain to ulceration of the duodenum, uremic ulcer, tuberculous ulcer, melena neonatorum, and duodenal ulcer. The symptoms, with their sequence of ‘pain, food, ease,’ were elucidated, as was the differential diagnosis of chronic duodenal ulcer. Another chapter deals in detail with treatment, ‘which should always be surgical.’ After describing various surgical methods, Moynihan concluded that ‘gastroenterostomy is by far the most satisfactory procedure.’’ Chapters on perforation and pathology are followed by an appendix giving histories of 189 cases Moynihan saw between 1900 and the end of 1909.

"Das weibliche Becken betrachtet in Beziehung auf seine Stellung und die Richtung seiner . . . ","","1825","&lt;p&gt;“Franz Carl Naegele (1778-1851) was the second and ablest son of a prominent German army surgeon, Joseph Naegele, of Düsseldorf. His elder brother, Anton, also made his mark as a physician, and his younger brother, Joseph II, followed their father&#39;s calling and distinguished himself in care of the wounded after Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Franz Carl was first appointed medical officer to the institute for the poor at Elberfeld-Barmen in the Rhineland, where he reformed the administration and medical service. He became professor of medicine at the ancient University of Heidelberg and in 1810 was named, in addition, director of the Lying-in Hospital there, a post he held for forty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recognized as the best practicing obstetrician of his time, he improved the instruments of his specialty and made a number of significant contributions to the scientific literature. His papers on calculating the length of pregnancy and on the mechanism of birth provided a scientific basis for obstetric practice. He also wrote about various aspects of obstetric pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His most important work concerned the anatomy of the pelvis and the problems presented by pelvic and spinal deformities in cases of difficult labor. This book, ‘The Female Pelvis Considered in Relation to Its Position and the Inclination of Its Curvature along with Contributions to the History of the Knowledge of the Pelvic Axis,’ based on his measurements of hundreds of patients and postmortem studies, gave a new precision to morphologic knowledge. The book comprises two parts. In the first, fourteen short anatomic chapters are devoted to his measurements and calculations undertaken to establish ‘detailed knowledge of the form and conditions of all the points which constitute a well-made pelvis.’ The second part contains a critical history of all that had been written on the subject of the pelvic axis since the pioneer study by Hendrik van Deventer, of Leyden, in 1701.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Naegele’s work not only was useful in itself but also set the example for much research during the next hundred years, which culminated in the classification of pelvic variations and their effects on labor published by the American obstetricians Caldwell and Moloy in 1933. Naegele himself published a study of the obliquely contracted pelvis in 1839. In his later years, he was assisted by his son, Herman Franz Joseph, who advanced the use of auscultation in midwifery” (Waife et al. 179).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, regional; diagnostic techniques, obstetrical and gynecological; obstetrics; orthopedics; osteology; spinal diseases","Carlsruhe","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Notes on Nursing","","1859","&lt;p&gt;“Florence Nightingale’s seventy-nine-page monograph, &lt;i&gt;Notes on Nursing&lt;/i&gt;, reflects the intelligence, efficiency, and administrative talent of the woman who inaugurated the professional training of nurses in England and, indirectly, in the United States. As a young woman, she had sought the best training for a nursing career then available. She chose the Institute of Protestant Deaconesses at Kaiserswerth, Germany, where she learned both nursing and hospital and training-school administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The need for radical reform in the care of the sick was made evident to Miss Nightingale (1820-1910) not only through her work in a London hospital but also through service in the barracks hospital in Scutari during the Crimean war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So effectively did she cut through ancient regulations in establishing a clean and efficiently run army hospital that, on her return to England, she was asked to establish a training school for nurses. The school opened at St. Thomas’s Hospital in 1860 with fifteen probationers, who lived at the hospital and were instructed by staff and visiting physicians. Graduates of the school were much sought after; many of them subsequently started nursing schools in England and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Notes on Nursing&lt;/i&gt; was written with simplicity and direct common sense, enlivened by occasional sharp wit. After an introductory chapter in which she stated that ‘nursing ought to assist the reparative process of disease,’ she discussed the conditions necessary for good nursing: ventilation and warmth; the ‘health of the house,’ or domestic hygiene; management (‘being in charge means that the work you do is not undone when your back is turned’); freedom from noise; selection of food; bed and bedding; personal cleanliness and the cleanliness of rooms and walls; and observation of the sick. In conclusion, she pointed out that her rules for nursing the sick applied even more to the care of children and puerperant women. In an appendix, she added statistics on the number of nurses employed at that time in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A disciple of the pioneer Belgian statistician, Adolphe Quetelet, Florence Nightingale supported all her writings with statistical evidence; she was the first to display this material in colored diagrams with proportioned areas.

"Serum Diagnosis of Syphilis and the Butyric Acid Test for Syphilis","","1910","&lt;p&gt;“Noguchi (1876-1928) came from Japan to the University of Pennsylvania as a research student in 1900. Young, poor, and alien, he was befriended by Simon Flexner, whom he followed to the new Rockefeller Institute in New York in 1904. His first work in this country was a study of all types of snake venom, their effects on the body, and the means by which snakebites should be treated. Noguchi elucidated the causes of many infectious diseases, studying in particular spirochetes and the vaccinia virus. In 1910, together with Flexner, he confirmed Schaudinn’s discovery that syphilis was due to &lt;i&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/i&gt;. Three years later, by finding these spirochetes in an impressively large series of autopsy specimens, he was able to establish that tabes dorsalis and general paralysis result from advanced syphilis of the spinal cord and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His study of Oroya fever, establishing &lt;i&gt;Bartonella bacilliformis&lt;/i&gt; as its agent and &lt;i&gt;Phlebotomus&lt;/i&gt; as the vector, was a major contribution to tropical medicine. In his last ten years he worked on yellow fever; he succumbed to this disease soon after Adrian Stokes, who had discovered the causative virus just before his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dedicated to Simon Flexner, the &lt;i&gt;Serum Diagnosis of Syphilis&lt;/i&gt; contains in its preface the statement that ‘the author endeavored to make it suitable for use by practicing physicians and students and at the same time with sufficient comprehensiveness to render it useful to laboratory workers.’ Noguchi explained in the first chapters how in-vitro hemolysis can be utilized to demonstrate antibodies in serum and how complement, antigens, and antibodies affect the hemolytic process. Later chapter provide step-by-step instructions for conducting the Wassermann reaction for syphilis and an appraisal, based on clinical and autopsy findings, of the value of that test. In the last chapter, Noguchi digresses to describe the butyric acid test, a simple procedure carried out on cerebrospinal fluid, which he devised for the diagnosis of advanced syphilitic disease of the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Characteristically, Noguchi took pains to present every relevant detail on the subjects about which he wrote and included in his book a discussion on the quantitative relationships of all factors playing a part in the Wassermann reaction.

"Serum Diagnosis of Syphilis and the Butyric Acid Test for Syphilis","","1910","&lt;p&gt;“Noguchi (1876-1928) came from Japan to the University of Pennsylvania as a research student in 1900. Young, poor, and alien, he was befriended by Simon Flexner, whom he followed to the new Rockefeller Institute in New York in 1904. His first work in this country was a study of all types of snake venom, their effects on the body, and the means by which snakebites should be treated. Noguchi elucidated the causes of many infectious diseases, studying in particular spirochetes and the vaccinia virus. In 1910, together with Flexner, he confirmed Schaudinn’s discovery that syphilis was due to &lt;i&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/i&gt;.

"The Principles and Practice of Medicine","","1892","&lt;p&gt;“Osler (1849-1919) was the outstanding physician of the English-speaking world at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. Canadian by birth, he trained in medicine at Toronto and McGill universities, taught for twenty years at the University of Pennsylvania and at Johns Hopkins University, and then, during his last fifteen years, as regius professor of medicine at Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is remembered as clinician, pathologist, and historian of medicine; the personal magnetism he exerted on colleagues and pupils was widely spread by his &lt;i&gt;Principles and Practice of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;. He wrote the book in fourteen months when he was forty-two, and it appeared in February, 1892. Meeting a widely felt need, it provided a rigidly systematized text on its internal medicine as well as relevant information from the great advances in laboratory sciences, particularly bacteriology, that had done so much to revolutionize medicine in the previous decades. Three thousand copies were sold in a month; through triennial revisions, the book became a standard text for students and practitioners over a period of thirty years, not only in English, but also in German, Spanish, French, and Chinese translations. Osler completed the eighth edition in 1912, and further editions were published for many years after his death in 1919. The chapters describe specific diseases by systems, a pattern since followed by most standard textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Osler is also remembered for his research and infectious and cardiovascular diseases (e.g., Osler’s nodes, Osler’s disease), as a founding editor of the &lt;i&gt;Quarterly Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, and as the author of &lt;i&gt;Aequanimitas&lt;/i&gt; (1904) and &lt;i&gt;An Alabama Student&lt;/i&gt; (1908). Both books address themselves to the philosophic, social, and ethical aspects of medical life. While at Oxford, Osler became curator of the Bodleian library. He was one of the greatest medical book collectors and the first to concentrate attention on the outstandingly influential books of successive centuries. He bequeathed his library to McGill University, Montreal, where he had graduated and held his first professorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Osler’s warm and charming personality, his great skill as a physician, his innovative restructuring of the medical school curriculum, and his many significant writings have made him the most important figure of his time in both English and North American medicine” (Waife et al. 233).&lt;/p&gt;","bacteriology; education, medical; history of medicine; internal medicine; microbiology; pathology; textbook","New York, United States","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Odontography: or, a Treatise on the Comparative Anatomy of the Teeth","","1845","&lt;p&gt;“This vast storehouse of detail on the structure of teeth was the first large-scale original work by Sir Richard Owen (1804-1892). A native of Lancaster, England, and a pupil of physiologist John Abernethy in London, he had prepared the five-volume &lt;i&gt;Physiological Catalogue,&lt;/i&gt; of John Hunter’s museum and had edited Hunter’s posthumous papers on comparative anatomy and zoology. He was an associate and son-in-law of Hunter’s secretary, William Clift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The scope of Owen’s writing, based on his own dissections and usually illustrated with his own drawings, has hardly been surpassed. He was forty-one when he completed this study, which was published in two volumes five years apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work covered the whole range of the toothed vertebrates, fossil and extant, and discussed in detail the microscopic structure of the teeth and the physiology of dentition. After a long introduction, Owen described the dental system of fishes, reptiles, and mammals. The dentition of extinct large reptiles and mammals as well as that of the marsupials and cetacea was included in his survey. Human dentition was treated in the section on mammals. The illustrations by several artists (including the author) are particularly impressive. They comprise 168 full-page plates, mostly lithographs; a few are colored engravings of microstructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a sense, dental anatomy and paleontology met here and were brought into the scientific limelight. Owen later wrote many long monographs and large-scale treatises on paleontology and comparative anatomy. One of these was &lt;i&gt;On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton&lt;/i&gt; (1848), written when he still held the belief that the identity of class, order, genus, and species could be traced back to the beginning of the universe. In his later years, eh became involved in hot controversy with Huxley over Darwinism but eventually was won over to the theory of the evolutionary development of species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was Hunterian professor for twenty years at the Royal College of Surgeons and from 1856 to 1883 was superintendent of the natural history department of the British Museum.

He was forty-one when he completed this study, which was published in two volumes five years apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work covered the whole range of the toothed vertebrates, fossil and extant, and discussed in detail the microscopic structure of the teeth and the physiology of dentition. After a long introduction, Owen described the dental system of fishes, reptiles, and mammals. The dentition of extinct large reptiles and mammals as well as that of the marsupials and cetacea was included in his survey. Human dentition was treated in the section on mammals. The illustrations by several artists (including the author) are particularly impressive. They comprise 168 full-page plates, mostly lithographs; a few are colored engravings of microstructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a sense, dental anatomy and paleontology met here and were brought into the scientific limelight. Owen later wrote many long monographs and large-scale treatises on paleontology and comparative anatomy. One of these was &lt;i&gt;On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton&lt;/i&gt; (1848), written when he still held the belief that the identity of class, order, genus, and species could be traced back to the beginning of the universe. In his later years, eh became involved in hot controversy with Huxley over Darwinism but eventually was won over to the theory of the evolutionary development of species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was Hunterian professor for twenty years at the Royal College of Surgeons and from 1856 to 1883 was superintendent of the natural history department of the British Museum. He died at the age of eighty-eight” (Waife et al. 195).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, comparative; dentition; paleodontology; tooth","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Der grossen Wundartzney","","1536","&lt;p&gt;“This volatile and versatile Swiss physician, surgeon, and chemist called himself ‘Paracelsus,’ meaning ‘greater than Celsus,’ the illustrious physician of ancient Rome. Paracelsus (1493-1541) was both an academic and a rebel. After studying at Ferrara, he spent a number of years traveling throughout Europe, collecting information not only from academicians but also from alchemists, gypsies, midwives, astrologers, barbers, and executioners. In this way, he acquired a practical body of knowledge that was in many ways at odds with the traditional medical teaching of his time. Paracelsus was appointed professor of medicine at Basel in 1527 but held the position only one year. During that year, he publicly burned the ‘Canon’ of Avicenna in a campaign to reform medical teaching, lectured in German instead of Latin, and quarreled with the authorities over fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most original medical thinker of the sixteenth century, Paracelsus was perhaps the first to apply chemistry to practical medicine. He rejected the four humors of the Greeks and substituted three alchemical elements—mercury, sulfur, and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Paracelsus taught that medicine could not advance solely by clinging to established ideas but that there must also be ‘experimentation controlled by authoritative literature.’ He was the first to note the association between cretinism and endemic goiter, to suggest that syphilis—or, as he called it, ‘French gonorrhea’—might be congenital in some cases, and to recommend the use of mercury in its treatment. However, he accepted mysticism and occultism, not omitting the astrologic influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His first book on surgical techniques was published in two volumes dated 1536. A pirated and unauthorized version of the first volume had been printed earlier in the same year at Ulm by Hans Varnier, who had armed himself with an imperial copyright privilege. Paracelsus justifiably defied this ‘copyright’ and, in his preface, energetically disavowed Varnier’s incomplete edition. He dealt with the complete treatment of wounds caused by piercing, shooting, burning, animal bites, bone fracture, and other injuries. Advocating sound surgical techniques, he also recognized the natural power of the body to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Disputatious and loud-voiced, Paracelsus spoke in the coarse words of a peasant rather than the refined language of his academic peers. In his last thirteen years, he resumed the wandering habits of his youth, practicing medicine and surgery throughout Germany. He died at the age of forty-eight in a tavern brawl in Salzburg” (Waife et al. 25).&lt;/p&gt;","alchemy; diagnosis; occultism; surgery, general; therapeutics","Augsburg, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Cinq Livres de Chirurgie","","1572","&lt;p&gt;“Ambroise Paré (1510-1950) rose to fame as an army surgeon during the foreign and civil wars that ravaged France in the sixteenth century. His books are notable for his vivid case histories, but he himself relied less on book learning than on his own experience and on learning by example. In his first work, a short treatise on the method of treating gunshot wounds (1545), he recommended that surgeons give up their traditional cauterizing of wounds with boiling oil, a treatment as dangerous as it was cruel. Paré’s second book, on anatomy, appeared in 1549, and by 1561 or 1562 he had completed another on the care of wounds and fractures of the head. His major surgical message, however, was detailed in two practical volumes, elegant in design but small enough for the field surgeon’s knapsack—the &lt;i&gt;Dix livres&lt;/i&gt; (‘Ten Books’) of 1564 and the &lt;i&gt;Cinq livres&lt;/i&gt; (‘Five Books’) of 1572.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In &lt;i&gt;Dix livres&lt;/i&gt;, Paré discussed war surgery, involving the treatment of gunshot and arrow wounds, fractures and dislocations, contusions, and burns; bone caries and gangrene; and urinary tract infections and strictures, kidney and bladder stones, and renal failure. There are many illustrations of instruments and appliances for reducing dislocations, a few illustrations of operations, and a picture of an artificial hand with articulated fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;i&gt;Cinq livres&lt;/i&gt; of 1572 deal again with bandaging, fractures, and dislocations but also with animal bites, gout, and fluxions. They are illustrated with drawings of instruments, appliances, and ligatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A year later, Paré published a similar volume, &lt;i&gt;Deux livres de chirurgie&lt;/i&gt; (‘Two Books on Surgery’). The &lt;i&gt;Deux livres&lt;/i&gt; discuss procreation and monsters and, in fact, concern obstetrics. Paré revived podolec version and had induced artificial labor in a case of uterine hemorrhage. Among his surgical innovations were an exarticulation of the elbow joint, the union of a fracture of the neck of the femur, and ligature instead of cauterization for amputations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these works were published in 1575 in a single large volume containing the twenty-six ‘books’ of his &lt;i&gt;Oeuvres&lt;/i&gt;. This compendium was later translated into Latin and several modern languages, including English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Paré’s medical writings, published without the permission of the Faculty of Medicine of the university of Paris and in the common tongue instead of learned Latin, provoked the anger of the physicians, who feared rivalry from surgeons. The physicians sought legal injunction against him in 1575, but he was again protected by the king, who had granted a ten-year privilege in 1572 ‘to employ such printers as seems good to him’” (Waife et al. 47).&lt;/p&gt;","armed conflicts; battlefield medicine; surgery; war-related injuries; wounds, nonpenetrating; wounds, penetrating","Paris, France","","","","image/jpg","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"An Essay on the Shaking Palsy","","1817","&lt;p&gt;“The name of James Parkinson (1755-1824) was immortalized by his description of the mysterious nervous disorder he named ‘the shaking palsy.’ His small and modest pamphlet, published in 1817 when he was sixty-two, is remarkable because his conclusions were reached entirely by inference from external symptoms. He recorded ten cases, differentiating paralysis agitans from other forms of paralytic disease, but remained in ‘uncertainty and indecision’ about the cause. He could neither indicate a cure nor suggest any useful treatment, because, he wrote, ‘internal medicines are scarcely warrantable . . . . all that art is capable of accomplishing is to check the further progress of the disease.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The little book has five chapter; the first defines the disease and illustrates it with six case histories. Chapter 2 contains descriptions of the two diagnostic symptoms—the ‘involuntary tremulous motions with lessened voluntary muscular power’ and ‘a propensity to bend the trunk forwards and to pass from a walking to a running pace.’ Chapter 3 differentiates shaking palsy from anomalous convulsion, disordered nervous control, and passive trembling. Chapter 4 suggests that the cause is some disease of the spinal marrow in the superior cervical vertebrae and the medulla oblongata. A case of convulsive policy following suspected injury of the spinal marrow is contrasted with four more case histories of the shaking palsy. The last chapter proposes bleeding or blistering at the neck in the hope of checking the disease. It is noteworthy that the book does not mention the characteristic masklike facies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parkinson, a general practitioner in London, attended John Hunter’s lectures on surgery (and recorded them in shorthand). He was the first to report in English on a case of appendicitis with perforation. He wrote another book on medical education, &lt;i&gt;The Hospital Pupil&lt;/i&gt;, which was well received after its publication in 1800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A political radical, he often engaged in agitations for reform, to the annoyance of those in government. He was an active pamphleteer, fighting for the disenfranchised, equitable taxes, legal protection of the poor, and other causes. He also contributed to chemistry, geology, and paleontology. His book on paralysis agitans remained the basic text on Parkinson’s disease until quite recent times and is still a masterful example of clinical description” (Waife et al. 171).&lt;/p&gt;","brain diseases; diagnosis; parkinson disease; pathology","London, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Die Arbeit der Verdauungsdrüsen","","1898","&lt;p&gt;“Pavlov’s lectures detailing his famous experiments on digestion were first published in Russian in 1897. The following year, a German translation appeared—&lt;i&gt;Die Arbeit der Verdauungsdrüsen&lt;/i&gt;. It is the German translation that is in the Lilly collection. Pavlov (1849-1936) was director of the Institute for Experimental Medicine in St. Petersburg when his book was published. By virtue of his ambidexterity and skill in handling laboratory dogs, particularly his operative formation of fistulas with intact nerve supply, Pavlov was able to acquire entirely new knowledge about the stimulation of gastric and pancreatic secretions. Discovering that the Vegas controls these secretions, Pavlov and his assistants next studied nervous reflexes and showed that they depend on reactions integrated in the cerebral cortex. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 1904.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pavlov&#39;s book of lectures was soon translated into French and English as well as German. After a general survey of the subject and his methods, he described the output of the digestive glands in response to feeding, the vagal efferent nerve supply of the gastric glands and pancreas, and a general scheme of the reflex pathways involved, including their relation to the salivary glands and appetite. His most original observations are reported on the period of occurrence and the importance of the ‘psychic,’ or appetitive, juice and gastric secretion in contrast to the relative inefficiency of merely mechanical stimulation by food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After studying higher nervous functions, in 1912 he enunciated his concept of ‘conditioned reflexes,’ the effect of repeated sensory or psychic stimuli on reflex action. Pavlov used the term ‘telephone exchange’ in depicting the central-nervous-system connections between a dog&#39;s senses and the organs of digestion. By conditioning the animal, he was able to elicit salivation from the parotid gland in response to pain and the ringing of a bell. Furthermore, he found that the salivary reflex could be conditioned not only to discriminate between the frequencies of beads of a metronome above and below 100 per minute but also to distinguish one-eighth variations in the tone of sound vibrations within and above the range of human hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pavlov&#39;s work continued after establishment of the Soviet regime, but he later resigned from several scientific organizations in protest against their political involvement. He died at the age of eighty-seven” (Waife et al. 241).&lt;/p&gt;","conditioning, psychological; digestive system; gastric juice; gastrointestinal hormones; gastrointestinal system","Wiesbaden, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

Two years later, he was called to La Salpêtrière, the famous hospital where the insane female patients were kept. Pinel had them placed in the care of sympathetic physicians and treated with compassion while doing away with other maltreatment, such as bloodletting, which had been employed previously for the purpose of repression. He prescribed quieting drugs for some and occupational therapy for others. Because of these innovations, he is considered the founder of ‘open-door’ psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pinel’s ‘Treatise on Mental Disease’ combines a psychologic study with a social program for the humane care and rehabilitation of the insane.

He included, on a foldout page of his book, a table listing pertinent data about patients he had cured. Although the date of publication is 1801, Pinel refers on page three to an unpublished report on the insane that had been submitted in 1791 or 1792 to the Société de Médecine.

Although it was based on clinical observation, the book was written in the deductive philosophic manner of the time, for the pathology of the brain was not understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pinel’s original contribution is in the final chapters; there reform in the management of his mental hospital is described, with occupational therapy as the fundamental law.’ The book ends with his principles for medical treatment and care in convalescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He refused an appointment as personal physician to Emperor Napoleon, possibly because he preferred to continue practicing, teaching, and studying” (Waife et al. 155).&lt;/p&gt;","behavioral sciences; convalescence; psychiatry; psychology","Paris, France","","","","image/jpg","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Klinische Studien über Vakzination und vakzinale Allergie","","1907","&lt;p&gt;“The Austrian pediatrician Pirquet (1874-1929) introduced the term ‘allergy’ and established immunology as a new specialty in medicine. In the Children’s Clinic at the University of Vienna, he studied infectious diseases and was the first to postulate that the incubation period ends with the formation of antibodies. He devised the tuberculosis test named for him, in which a small area of skin is scarified through a drop of tuberculin, and, with Bela Schick, he established the concept of serum sickness. Later he developed the theory of autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His book on vaccination is the first work in immunology to involve the scientific analysis of a large series of clinical cases. It begins with a summary history of the hypotheses concerning reactions to vaccination and a statement of the objects and methods of immunization. The main text is divided into three parts: vaccination, revaccination, and theory. The first and second parts are based on the statistical evaluation of many case histories from the Children’s Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The section on theory describes Pirquet’s concept of allergy and undertakes to explain the differences between early and delayed reactions to vaccination. After discussing pock exanthema and the agglutination theory, he points out the diagnostic value of ‘allergy,’ which he defined as ‘an altered susceptibility in regard to the whole group of pock diseases, had not an immunity in the strict sense.’ He further described it as ‘The bridge between hypersensitivity and immunity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although most of Pirquet’s career was spent in the medical centers of Austria and Poland, he came to the United States in 1908 and held the chair of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University for two years. Upon his return to Europe, he filled similar positions at Breslau and Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pirquet became interested in nutrition after 1910 and was a commissioner for food distribution during the famine in Vienna following World War I. In this capacity, he was credited with innovative programs to aid the starving infants, especially in providing them with an adequate milk supply. In his last years, he studied the allergies of old age and the role of aging in the incidence of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pirquet’s intellectual brilliance was marred by emotional instability. At the age of fifty-five, seemingly in good physical and mental health, he took his own life” (Waife et al. 251).&lt;/p&gt;","allergy and immunology; hypersensitivity; immunization, secondary; pediatrics; vaccinology","Leipzig, Germany; Vienna, Austria","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Neue Beitrage zur Kenntniss des Sehens in subjectiver Hinsicht","","1825","&lt;p&gt;“Purkinje (1787-1869) was graduated in 1819 from Charles University in Prague, Bohemia, then the third kingdom of the Austrian Empire, and was appointed to the chair of physiology at the University of Breslau in Saxony early in 1823. His graduation dissertation had concerned subjective visual phenomena, a topic he further explored in his three-part article published in 1825. Some of the findings reflect Purkinje’s experiments on himself after he had taken belladonna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Purkinje was a histologist and a physiologist. He was one of the most original of the young men in many countries who, by using up-to-date improved microscopes, were advancing rapidly in knowledge of living processes. He reported new observations on myopia, hypermetropia, and accommodation and on reflex eye movements, including nystagmus, while noting the impossibility of observing the inner eye in the living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1850, Purkinje returned to his native country as professor of physiology at Prague, a position he retained until his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In preparing tissues for microscopic examination, Purkinje was the first to employ a properly focused light source of high intensity, a microtome, potassium bichromate, glacial acetic acid, and Canada balsam. Whereas microscopy had until then proven not much more than the means of magnifying tissue architecture, these contributions permitted the detailed study of the types of cells that characterize a tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While studying the structure of the brain, Purkinje noted those ganglionic cells that are peculiar to the cerebellum and are now called ‘Purkinje cells.’ Likewise, he was the first to describe the ‘Purkinje fibers’ of the heart. He introduced the word ‘protoplasm,’ invented investigative instruments such as moving recorders for the study of cardiac action, and gained an international reputation for his discoveries in cytology, embryology, and cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of his important works were overlooked for decades because they were in his native Czech.  However, he himself was fluent in no less than twelve languages. Many of his significant discoveries were made in his home laboratory. Purkinje’s wide-ranging interests included the inventing of a spirometer and a hearing aid, a detailed study of fingerprints, and investigation of gastric secretion. In his spare time, he founded a journal of natural history” (Waife et al. 177).&lt;/p&gt;","histology; microbiology; ophthalmology; pathology; vision, ocular; vision disorders","Berlin, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"De Morbis Artificum Diatriba","","1700","&lt;p&gt;“Although Ramazzini (1633-1714) served as professor of medicine at Modena and subsequently at Padua, he is best remembered for his pioneer treatise on occupational disease. The book reflects an interest that Ramazzini acquired late in life; it was published in 1700, more than forty years after he had received his degree as doctor of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ramazzini’s concern with occupational diseases developed naturally from his studies of the environment as a cause of disease. The treatise covers the illnesses associated with forty to fifty different occupations, including general chapters on diseases of sedentary and standing workers and those of literary men. The first systematic survey of the subject, this book was reprinted at Utrecht in 1703, and an anonymous English translation appeared in 1705. At the age of eighty, Ramazzini revised the book; that expanded edition was published in 1713, the year before his death. He added new observations throughout, rearranging the second half of the volume and including a supplement of twelve new chapters on trades previously undescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Among his more astute observations are his accounts of the ‘phthisis’ acquired by stonemasons and miners (silicosis and pneumoconiosis), the eye problems of printers and gilders, the sciatica of tailors, and the lethargy of potters. Ramazzini pointed out that, in some lines of work, disorders can result from the strain of unusual physical demands or postures, such as those required of tailors; in other occupations, workers can develop disease from exposure to dangerous substances, such as lead or mercury. Ramazzini continues to be honored in Italy to this day by a medical journal that bears his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ramazzini was also interested in epidemiology. From 1690 to 1695, he studied and then described a severe Italian epidemic of malarial fever. He became greatly concerned about this disease, which was endemic near undrained marshlands, and promoted the use of cinchona bark, as Thomas Sydenham was advocating, saying that cinchona did for medicine what gunpowder had done for war. He studied the effect of weather on recurrence of diseases and published his ‘barometric diary’ in 1710, just as Sydenham’s follower John Locke had done in England in 1692” (Waife et al. 99).&lt;/p&gt;","diagnosis; occupational diseases; pathology; pneumoconiosis; silicosis","Modena, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Traité pratique des maladies vénériennes . . .","","1838","&lt;p&gt;“In his authoritative &lt;i&gt;Treatise on the Venereal Disease&lt;/i&gt; (1786), John Hunter declared that syphilis and gonorrhea were manifestations of a single disease. The error arose when he inoculated himself with syphilis without knowing that he had also infected himself with gonorrhea. Differentiation of the two diseases was established fifty years later by Philippe Ricord (1800-1889), whose experiments are recorded in his thorough ‘Practical Treatise on Venereal Diseases.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ricord was born of French parents in Baltimore, Maryland, but went to France for his surgical training under Dupuytren, Lisfranc, and other great teachers of the Paris school. He was graduated with an M.D. degree in 1826 and spent his long, active career wholly in France as a specialist in venereal diseases. He was a surgeon to the Hôpital du Midi in Paris, held a professorial chair, and conducted a large private practice. Possessed of a compassionate interest in alleviating suffering, he was renowned also as a wit and writer of light verse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ricord had already written books on gonorrhea and on chancre when he published this outstanding treatise. Beginning with a ‘critical and general’ discussion, the book recorded his conclusions that there is a unique syphilitic ‘virus,’ that gonorrhea is a different disease, that syphilis can be divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary stages, and that prophylactic treatment against the later stages is available. He gave credit for first correcting Hunter’s error to J. F. Hernandez, who had published an essay on the ‘Nonidentity of Syphilis and Gonorrhea’ in French in 1812, but it was Ricord’s own detailed presentation of his experimental results in this treatise that established the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The central section of the book, giving his experiments in detail, demonstrated that the pus of a chancre produces syphilis but inoculation with a gonorrheal secretion does not. He went on to describe his method of treatment and appended a brief formulary of the mineral medications employed in his clinic. It was shown that mercury was not a universal specific and that some so-called secondary infections were due to mercury poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lengthy work was completed in the first decade of Ricord’s medical practice. His book achieved immediate success. It was revised many times and widely translated; thirteen American editions were published between 1843 and 1858. Ricord raised the treatment of venereal disease to a level not to be surpassed for seventy years” (Waife et al. 191).&lt;/p&gt;","gonorrhea; infections; sexually transmitted diseases; syphilis","Paris, France","","","","compound_object","French","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Traité pratique des maladies vénériennes . . .","","1838","&lt;p&gt;“In his authoritative &lt;i&gt;Treatise on the Venereal Disease&lt;/i&gt; (1786), John Hunter declared that syphilis and gonorrhea were manifestations of a single disease. The error arose when he inoculated himself with syphilis without knowing that he had also infected himself with gonorrhea. Differentiation of the two diseases was established fifty years later by Philippe Ricord (1800-1889), whose experiments are recorded in his thorough ‘Practical Treatise on Venereal Diseases.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ricord was born of French parents in Baltimore, Maryland, but went to France for his surgical training under Dupuytren, Lisfranc, and other great teachers of the Paris school. He was graduated with an M.D. degree in 1826 and spent his long, active career wholly in France as a specialist in venereal diseases. He was a surgeon to the Hôpital du Midi in Paris, held a professorial chair, and conducted a large private practice. Possessed of a compassionate interest in alleviating suffering, he was renowned also as a wit and writer of light verse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ricord had already written books on gonorrhea and on chancre when he published this outstanding treatise. Beginning with a ‘critical and general’ discussion, the book recorded his conclusions that there is a unique syphilitic ‘virus,’ that gonorrhea is a different disease, that syphilis can be divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary stages, and that prophylactic treatment against the later stages is available. He gave credit for first correcting Hunter’s error to J. F. Hernandez, who had published an essay on the ‘Nonidentity of Syphilis and Gonorrhea’ in French in 1812, but it was Ricord’s own detailed presentation of his experimental results in this treatise that established the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The central section of the book, giving his experiments in detail, demonstrated that the pus of a chancre produces syphilis but inoculation with a gonorrheal secretion does not.

"Handbuch der pathologischen Anatomie","","1842, 1844, 1846","&lt;p&gt;“Carl Rokitansky (1804-1878), born in Bohemia, was one of an illustrious group who were credited with reestablishing Vienna as an important center of medical research. He studied in Prague and Vienna, where he graduated in medicine, and then spent his entire career in the pathology laboratory. He and Josef Skoda, the clinician, were the leading founders of the revolutionary movement that became known as the New Vienna School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having access to the great hospitals of Vienna, where he was professor of pathology in the university, Rokitansky became the most thoroughly equipped pathologist of his time. By decree of Emperor Joseph II, all patients who died in hospitals were to be autopsied. This allowed Rokitansky to perform some thirty thousand postmortems himself during his lifetime and to have available the findings of more than thirty thousand others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His ‘Handbook of Pathologic Anatomy’ provided the nineteenth century with a fund of pathologic observation comparable in scope to Morgagni’s in the previous century. The work is in three volumes, but they were published in reverse order. Volume III appeared first, in 1842, and dealt with abnormalities of the respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems. Volume II, issued in 1844, contained sections on abnormalities of cellular, serious, and mucous tissues, the skin, fibers, bone, muscle, and the vascular and nervous systems. In these volumes were the first accounts of acute yellow atrophy of the liver and an improved concept of pneumonia. Congenital malformations were meticulously described. Volume I, containing the general survey, finally came out in 1846. Both volumes II and III were reissued without alteration, presumably because the publisher had underestimated their chances for success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rokitansky’s observations and descriptions were original and impeccable. Some of his theories, however, especially his chemical hypothesis of tissue change, were misconceived and outdated. They were so sharply criticized by Virchow in the &lt;i&gt;Medizinicsche Zeitung&lt;/i&gt; in 1846 that Rokitansky omitted them from later editions of his work.

He was one of the founders of Dickinson College and of the school now known as Franklin and Marshall College and, for the last fourteen years of his life, was Treasurer of the United States Mint” (Waife et al. 147).&lt;/p&gt;","epidemics; virus diseases; yellow fever","Philadelphia, USA","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Tabulae Neurologicae ad illustrandam Historiam Anatomicam Cardiacorum Nervorum . . .","","1794","&lt;p&gt;“Antonio Scarpa (1752-1832), born in Venice, was the most brilliant pupil of Morgagni, the great anatomist and clinical pathologist at Padua. Scarpa received his medical degree at the age of eighteen and, at twenty, was appointed professor of anatomy at Modena. Here he immediately published, with his own superb illustrations, a book on his discovery of the membranous labyrinth in the ear. When he was thirty-one, he moved to the more important chair of anatomy at Pavia, which he held for twenty years. In 1787, in addition, he assumed the chair of surgery and held it until 1812. He was equally distinguished as research worker, surgeon, and teacher; wrote well in Latin and Italian; and drew his own illustrations with skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps his greatest achievement was his large atlas of ‘Neurologic Plates,’ illustrating the cardiac, cerebral, glossopharyngeal, and pharyngeal nerves. This was published in Latin in 1794. The text includes a general essay on neurology, with accurate criticism of illustrations published by earlier anatomists, such as Willis, Vieussens, and von Haller. The essay is followed by descriptions of his own plates, providing brief, precise comments on the nerves illustrated, with mention of previous accounts. The seven engravings are so large that some organs are pictured life-size. Engraved by Faustino Anderloni from Scarpo’s drawings, the plates are both accurate and brilliant in light and shade. The book offered the first detailed representation and description of the nerves of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The author is best remembered for Scarpa’s triangle, an area bordered by the inguinal ligament and superficial thigh muscles. It was first delineated in his report on an operation for popliteal aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scarpa’s anatomic investigations spanned a period of nearly sixty years and included comparative studies of the auditory and olfactory apparatus and the deep structure of bone. His surgical work covered masterly and influential research on the diseases of the eye, congenital clubfoot, aneurysms, hernia, and arterial disease. On each subject, Scarpa offered new knowledge with practical application for the surgeon and clear, well-defined illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scarpa became director of the Medical Institute at Pavia and continued his research and writing until a year before his death at eighty-one. His work as surgeon and anatomist was carried on in the best tradition of the Italian school” (Waife et al. 145).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy; anatomy, artistic; atlas; nervous system; nervous system physiological phenomena; neuroanatomy","Pavia, Italy","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Die Aetiologie, der Bergriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers","","1861","&lt;p&gt;“In the 1840’s, Semmelweis (1818-1875), a young Hungarian assistant in the obstetric clinic at the General Hospital in Vienna, noted a startling difference between the mortalities of the hospital’s two maternity wards. In 1847, the mortality of the first ward, which was staffed by medical students who moved freely from the morgue to the maternity wards, was 11.4 percent; in the second ward, staffed by midwives, who were not permitted to work in the morgue, the mortality was 2.7 percent. Semmelweis reasoned that puerperal fever was brought into the first ward by the medical students, who had been conducting postmortem examinations on cadavers in the morgue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A twelve-month trial was initiated to test his thesis. During that time, the medical students were required to wash their hands in a chlorinated lime solution before touching or examining a pregnant woman. At the end of the test period, the mortality in the first ward had declined strikingly and was slightly lower than that in the second ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Semmelweis was not only a pioneer of asepsis in obstetrics; he recognized that puerperal fever is a form of septicemia. He was not the first to point out that puerperal fever is contagious; Oliver Wendell Holmes, in America, had read a paper on the contagiousness of puerperal fever to the Boston Society for Medical Improvement in 1843. Holmes and Semmelweis apparently did not know of each other’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Semmelweis’s theory was violently resisted by many orthodox obstetricians of the day, just as that of Holmes had been opposed in America. So strong was the opposition to Semmelweis that he returned to Hungary, where he became professor of obstetrics at the University of Pest and director of St. Rochus Hospital. In 1861, almost fifteen years after he had begun to document his observations, he published his treatise on ‘The Cause, Treatment, and Prophylaxis of Puerperal Fever.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, nearly half of the long book consists of a controversial survey of other men’s opinions of his work. He pursued the controversy in his scathing ‘Open Letters to Sundry Professors of Obstetrics,’ which appeared in three pamphlets in 1861. (Two of these exceedingly rare items are also in the Lilly Library.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rejection, opposition, and controversy were more than Semmelweis could bear. In 1865, when he was forty-seven, friends committed him to a mental hospital in Vienna. There he died within two weeks from a dissection wound. Ironically, his death had been attributed to septicemia, a variant of the disease he had tried to eradicate during his professional life” (Waife et al. 219).&lt;/p&gt;","hand hygiene; hygiene; obstetrics; occupational health; therapeutics","Leipzig, Germany; Vienna, Austria","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Account of a New Anaesthetic Agent, as a Substitute for Sulphuric Ether in Surgery and Midwifery","","1847","&lt;p&gt;“Sir James Young Simpson (1811-1870), who was elected professor of midwifery at the University of Edinburgh when he was only twenty-nine, is credited with introducing inhalation anesthesia into obstetrics. As a brilliant practitioner and pioneer advocate of the use of anesthesia in childbirth and surgical operations, he was one of the founders of modern obstetrics and gynecology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the age of thirty-five, he was appointed physician to Queen Victoria in Scotland, but the event was overshadowed by another of greater importance to him. ‘Flattery from the Queen is perhaps not common flattery,’ he wrote a few days later, ‘but I am far less interested in it than having delivered a woman this week without any pain while inhaling sulphuric ether. I can think of nought else.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, he was not satisfied that ether, with its unpleasant side-effects, was the best anesthetic possible and continued to experiment with chemicals. On November 4, 1847, he and two assistants tested a new one, chloroform, on themselves, and he was elated with the results. Almost immediately, he had the opportunity to deliver a colleague’s wife of a baby girl under the new anesthetic. Within two weeks, the twenty-three-page pamphlet, &lt;i&gt;Account of a New Anaesthetic Agent&lt;/i&gt;, was published. (The Lilly Library copy is bound with three other pamphlets by Simpson on the subjects of anesthesia and childbirth.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since midwifery, as then practiced, was based on the belief that labor pains were a ‘desirable, salutary, and conservative manifestation of life-force,’ Simpson became a focus of controversy. Although opposed by many of his colleagues on ‘moral’ and ‘religious’ grounds, he was the idol of his patients, who flocked to Edinburgh from throughout the British Isles. The debate with his peers began to die down only when, in 1853, Queen Victoria chose to take chloroform at the birth of Prince Leopold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Several instruments and gynecologic procedures were also introduced by Simpson, who held strong and farsighted theories that infections were being transmitted from patient to patient within the hospitals. During his busy lifetime, he published some two-hundred articles on medical subjects and found time to write about twenty more on another interest of his, archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After twice rejecting offers of royal recognition in the form of a title, Simpson finally accepted a baronetcy. Upon his death from heart disease at the age of fifty-nine, his family refused the tomb in Westminster Abbey, because he had wished to be buried among some of his children” (Waife et al. 201).&lt;/p&gt;","chloroform; observation; obstetrics; organic chemicals; therapeutic use","Edinburgh, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Uterine Surgery","","1866","&lt;p&gt;“Sims (1813-1883), a graduate of Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, became the founder of modern gynecologic surgery in the United States. His operative techniques were perfected when, as a young man practicing in Alabama, he undertook to treat slave girls suffering from vesicovaginal fistula. He applied his new methods in curing these young women who, without his attention, would have been allowed to die. The operation for closure of vesicovaginal fistula, in which he used silver wire sutures, has been named for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He moved to New York in 1853 and there distinguished himself as the leading gynecologic surgeon. In 1861, he introduced his operation for amputation of the uterine cervix and later invented the duckbill vaginal speculum, which was also named for him. In addition, he discovered that the left lateral position—Sims’ position—is more convenient for gynecologic procedures than the knee-chest position. The speculum, this position, and a good light, he wrote, ‘are all that are necessary for obtaining an accurate view of the parts. If the vagina and outlet are ordinarily capacious, a good strong northern light, of a clear day, from a large solitary window, is all-sufficient. But if this canal has been narrowed by cicatrices after extensive sloughs, or from other causes, then sunlight is absolutely necessary for every stage of the operation from first to last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the War between the States, Sims, a Southern sympathizer, was in Europe. ‘In 1862,’ he wrote, ‘I voluntarily left my own country, on account of its political troubles.’ He introduced his successful methods in London and Paris, where he was entertained by Napoleon III and had the Empress Eugenie for his patient. ‘After three years in a most favourable position in the highest circles of practice in Europe,’ as he wrote in his dedication, he published this masterly account of his work, first in London and then in New York. It was soon translated into German and proved to be a major contribution to gynecology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book is written in clear and simple language. After detailing his new method of uterine examination, Sims deals in eight sections with the physiology, anatomy, and surgery of the female pelvic organs, including an account of their pathology and abnormalities and the mechanism of conception. He also records a method of artificial fertilization that he had employed. The book is well illustrated and thoroughly indexed” (Waife et al. 225).&lt;/p&gt;","reproductive health; reproductive medicine; surgery","New York, United States","","","","compound_object","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Elementorum Myologiae Specimen, seu Musculi descriptio Geometrica","","1667","&lt;p&gt;“Nicolaus Steno, or Niels Stensen (1638-1686), was taught in Copenhagen by the renowned Dane, Thomas Bartholin, and then spent four years in Holland; there, at the age of twenty-four, he published his ‘Anatomical Observations on the Vessels of the Mouth, Eyes and Nose,’ which included his discovery of the parotid duct (named for him). Upon returning to Copenhagen in 1664, he published his pioneer work on muscles and glands. This was supplemented three years later by his ‘Elements of Myology, a Geometric Description of Muscles,’ printed in Florence, where he had settled in 1666.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the book on muscles and glands, Steno advanced his theories on the muscles of the digestive organs, followed by a description of muscle fibers. In this, he explained how the tensile strength of each fiber contributes to the action of the whole muscle and demonstrated that the heart is a muscle. He discussed the glands of the oral cavity, the lymphatics, the tear glands, and the milk glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Elements of Myology,’ expanding his concepts, provides a mechanistic explanation of muscular physiology. From the histologic appearance of muscle and of the nerves supplying them, Steno deduced that the apparent increase in muscle size during contraction represents a change in shape rather than an increase in bulk. Earlier writings on this topic, which postulated the flow of fluid from the nerves into the muscles during contraction, Steno termed ‘mere words, meaning nothing!’ In a two-part appendix to this book, he described dentition of the shark and made an important correlation between the ovaries of the viviparous shark and the human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Willis had correctly deduced that the cerebrum is the center for thought, but he arbitrarily assigned perception to the corpora striata, imagination to the corpus callosum, and instinct to the midbrain. Steno denounced Willis for having thus speculated without experimental evidence or knowledge of the anatomic connections involved. Steno’s criticisms of Willis and other anatomists appear in an important discourse on the anatomy of the brain (Paris, 1669). He contributed anatomic papers to &lt;i&gt;Acta Medica et Philosophica Hafniensia&lt;/i&gt;, the earliest medical periodical, and examined the fossil content of sedimentary rock strata, which he described in &lt;i&gt;De Solido intra Solidum&lt;/i&gt; in 1669. For that monograph he is regarded as one of the founders of geology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Late in his life, he gave up science for religion. Having been converted from his Lutheran faith to Catholicism, he was consecrated a bishop and went to a diocese in northern Germany, where he died at the age of forty-eight” (Waife et al. 79).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, artistic; anatomy, comparative; myology; parotid gland","Florence, Italy","","","","compound_object","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"A Treatise on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases of the Chest","","1837","&lt;p&gt;“Stokes (1804-1878) was the son of a prominent Irish physician, intellectual, and political activist. During his career, he succeeded his father first as a physician to the Meath Hospital in Dublin and later as regius professor of medicine at the University of Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a boy, the younger Stokes often accompanied his father on archaeologic and scientific excursions into the Irish countryside and undoubtedly learned much about meticulous observation on these trips. At the age of twenty-one, while still a student in Edinburgh, he wrote &lt;i&gt;An Introduction to the Use of the Stethoscope&lt;/i&gt;, the first systematic English treatise to follow Laënnec’s book of 1819. It is credited with giving significant impetus to acceptance of the stethoscope as a diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The masterly &lt;i&gt;Diseases of the Chest&lt;/i&gt;, published when Stokes was thirty-three, was the fruit of twelve years’ experience and established his reputation. Intending it to meet the needs of the practicing physician, he simplified the descriptions and explained the principles, rather than the details, of treatment. He extended the studies of Laënnec and Corvisart on the physical signs and symptoms of pulmonary illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After discussion of the diagnosis of thoracic disease, Stokes dealt in turn with disorders of the mucous membrane (including bronchitis in particular), the larynx, and the trachea; pneumonia; gangrene of the lung; and disease of the pleura. Among other new observations, he described paralysis of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm after pleurisy and the use of the stethoscope to detect foreign bodies in the air passages. His monograph was certainly one of the most famous contributions of the Irish school of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although Stokes never wrote the projected second part of his treatise on the lungs, he made a notable addition in later years to medical literature and to the study of heart disease with publication of &lt;i&gt;The Diseases of the Heart and Aorta&lt;/i&gt; (1854). His name has been perpetuated in the eponyms “Stokes-Adams Syndrome” (heart block and syncope), “Cheyne-Stokes respiration,” and Stokes’ expectorant” (Waife et al. 187).&lt;/p&gt;","auscultation; diagnosis; diagnostic techniques, cardiovascular; lung diseases; pathology; pulmonary medicine; respiration; stethoscope","Dublin, Ireland","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Observationes medicæ circa morborum acutorum historiam et curationem","","1685","&lt;p&gt;“Among the notable medical books in the Lilly collection, this work by Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689) stands out because it does not announce a major original discovery or the foundation of a new development in medicine. Instead, Sydenham’s contribution was the reintroduction of the Hippocratic method of careful clinical observation based on wide personal experience. As a recorder of the natural history of disease, he had few equals. For example, even today one can read his description of an acute attack of gout with profit and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His medical education was interrupted twice by military service under Cromwell. Although his formal edication in medicine was somewhat limited, he was a most successful clinician. Conservative and even distrustful of scientific innovations, Sydenham approached the treatment of disease with empiricism. His personal influence was so strong that most of the leading clinicians of the next generation may be considered directly or indirectly his pupils. His contributions, however, were not truly appreciated until after his death, when he came to be known as the ‘English Hippocrates.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is interesting that the original &lt;i&gt;Observations&lt;/i&gt; were written in English and published in 1676. The translation into Latin (the proper language of science at the time) was printed nine years later by John Mapletoft, to whom Sydenham dedicated the book. It includes sections on diseases, especially those seen in London epidemics between 1661 and 1675, and the characteristics and treatment of continuous and intermittent fevers, for which he introduced cinchona bark into general use in England. He discussed ‘pest’ (bubonic plague) and smallpox, recommending a regimen of cooling drinks for the latter, and described cholera, dysentery, bilious colic, epidemic cough, pleurisy, pneumonia and ‘false pneumonia,’ rheumatism, and quinsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although Sydenham’s notions of the causes of fevers and epidemics were traditional (he believed in ‘epidemic constitutions’ and the influence of atmospheric ‘miasma’), he did note the rhythmic periodicity of the recurrence of epidemics. He also recognized precise ‘species’ of disease, made a distinction between smallpox and measles, and gave the first diagnostic account of scarlatina. He continued to advocate bloodletting in moderation, but his other treatments were simple and sensible: fresh air in the sickroom, exercise for consumptives, iron tonics for anemia, and liquid opiates (laudanum) for pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sydenham gained fame through his ‘Treatise on Gout and Dropsy’ (1683), in which he differentiated gout from rheumatism, but his most enduring work was the &lt;i&gt;Observationes Medicae&lt;/i&gt;. His classic account of hysteria appears in &lt;i&gt;Dissertatio Epistolaris&lt;/i&gt; (1682)” (Waife et al. 89).&lt;/p&gt;","clinical medicine; epidemeology; evidence-based medicine; observation","London, England","","","","compound_object","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

The final plates show the separation of the flap and removal of the bandages. The linear woodcuts give instructive detail.

The ‘Directions for Management of Infants from the Birth’ again follow Armstrong’s method but add enlightened instructions as to psychologic aspects, the ‘passions of the mind,’ including control of ‘the tempers of wet-nurses.’ Underwood was also a pioneer in the development of artificial infant feedings that were nutritionally sound and came close to duplicating the food values found in mother’s milk.

"The Diseases of Children","","1784","&lt;p&gt;“Michael Underwood (1737-1820) published &lt;i&gt;A Treatise on the Diseases of Children&lt;/i&gt; in 1784, one year after another physician-author, George Armstrong, had issued the last version of his &lt;i&gt;Essay&lt;/i&gt; on the same subject.

Libri Septem.","","1543","&lt;p&gt;“This magnificent volume entitled &lt;i&gt;De Humani Corporis Fabrica&lt;/i&gt; successfully explores human anatomy in great detail, an area in which many other explorers had failed. Vesalius (1514-1564) was only twenty-eight when the publication appeared. He took infinite care to ensure that everything about his book—paper, type, illustrations, layout, and production—was worthy of its text. The woodcuts by Jan Stephan Kalkar were innovative in that they were designed with a landscape background. Works of greater magnificence and scientific substance exist, but no other single book so successfully combines all these excellencies. Vesalius’s confidence that it would be studied and his apprehension that it would be plagiarized led him, as his title page proclaims, to obtain the sponsorship and copyright protection of the three great powers of the time—the emperor, the king of France, and the Grand Council of Venice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The seven ‘books’ deal in turn with the bones and cartilages, the ligaments and muscles, the blood vessels, the nerves, the abdominal organs, the thoracic organs, and the brain and sense organs. This arrangement of material according to the ‘systems’ of the body was in itself revolutionary, for earlier works on anatomy had followed the procedure of the lecturer, who began with the most perishable tissues—the organs in the body cavities—and then continued with other parts, such as the limbs, trunk, and head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;i&gt;Fabrica&lt;/i&gt; is essentially a textbook but one most richly illustrated. Vesalius arranged for it to be published simultaneously with his &lt;i&gt;Epitome&lt;/i&gt;, which has a briefer text and larger plates. The author had also provided a general atlas in his ‘Six Anatomic Tables’ (Venice, 1538). The plates in all three volumes were the first to combine scientific accuracy with the illusion of three dimensions. The &lt;i&gt;Fabrica&lt;/i&gt; is famous for its full-page skeletons, but the rest of its illustrations are almost as remarkable, if less striking. Here, for the first time, are presented accurately drawn details of organs, blood vessels, and nerves, designed and placed so as to clarify the descriptions in the text. Vesalius expressed forceful criticisms of the Galenic tradition based on animal anatomy, corroborating them from his own dissections. Some of these criticisms were his own, and some had been voiced by others during the fifty years since the time of Leonardo da Vinci.

"Neurographia Universalis . . .","","1685","&lt;p&gt;“Vieussens (1641-1715), professor of medicine at Montpellier, published a detailed study of the nervous system that was regarded as the best account written in the seventeenth century. It was illustrated with thirty particularly fine engravings by Jean Beaudeau, most of them on foldout pages larger than the pages of the book. It also contained a splendid portrait of the author by Boulanger. Vieussens was an untiring dissector, and his work revealed the structure and arrangement of the nervous system better than that of any predecessor in addition to recording new and correct observations. For example, he showed that the spinal cord was an independent structure, not merely an appendage of the brain, and he first defined the centrum ovale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book, which is divided into three parts, discusses the brain, the spinal cord, and the nerves. It was based on 500 dissections of postmortem material. The words ‘Editio Nova’ on the page indicate a new and original publication rather than a ‘new edition’ in the modern sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vieussens was physician to the royal court in Paris from about 1688 to 1698. During this period, he became interested in chemical physiology and was among the first to study the chemistry of the blood and saliva. His exploration of the heart and blood vessels was recorded in three volumes issued late in his life. He also published an important, though less original, monograph on the structure of the ear. His investigations on the cardiovascular system resulted in many new anatomic and pathologic observations—for instance, the correct structure of the left ventricle of the heart, the course of the coronary vessels, and the coronary sinus.

"Die Cellularpathologie in ihrer Begrundung auf pysiologische und pathologische Gewebelehre","","1858","&lt;p&gt;“Virchow (1821-1902) was one of the greatest medical men of the nineteenth century, excelling as teacher, physiologist, pathologist, and practical hygienic expert, with an added interest in anthropology. He was an active politician whose liberal sympathies led him into trouble with the authorities I n1848, the year of abortive revolution. Because of this, he had to resign his position at the University of Berlin and leave the city. He was forgiven later, asked to return, made professor of pathology at the university, and given the directorship of the Pathologic Institute, a position created for him. He served as a member of the Reichstag from 1880 to 1893.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Virchow’s impressive list of achievements includes his observations and definitions of leukocytosis and leukemia and his descriptions of the many types of thrombosis and embolism, which he saw as a sequel to phlebitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This book was the foundation of all subsequent work in pathology. Virchow accepted the theory of the cellular structure of living tissue that had been advanced by Schwann but disagreed with his concepts of protoplasm, the cytoblast, and the orgin of cells. He enunciated the dictum that ‘every cell arises from a cell’ and regarded the body as ‘a cell-state in which every cell is a citizen,’ disease being ‘merely a conflict of citizens in this states, brought about by the action of external forces.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book was based on twenty lectures delivered in April, 1858, at the Pathologic Institute. Beginning with a survey of the development of the cell theory from Bichat to Schwann, Virchow discussed the physiology and pathology of tissues in general and went on to describe the cellular conditions of disease processes in nutrition, circulation, the blood and lymph, and the nervous system. In addition, he dealt with the cellular basis of disturbances in function, irritability of tissues, fatty degeneration and metamorphosis, inflammation, normal and pathologic regeneration, and the character of regenerated tissue. The book was revised several times, without marked alteration, and was translated into English by Frank Chance in 1860.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Late in his life, many honors were bestowed on Virchow. He dedicated the Pathologic Museum in 1899 and gave it his personal collection of more than twenty-three thousand specimens, each of which he had personally prepared and labeled. On his eightieth birthday he received a gold medal from Kaiser Wilhelm II and, shortly before he died in 1902, witnessed the completion of the new Berlin municipal hospital, which is named for him” (Waife et al. 213).&lt;/p&gt;","cell biology; histology; pathology; physiology","Berlin, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Anatomical Description of the Arteries of the Human Body, illustrated by several coloured Engravings . . . ","","1813","&lt;p&gt;“John Collins Warren (1778-1856) was the son of John Warren, one of the founders of Harvard Medical school and a leading surgeon in Boston. The younger Warren was trained in Londo, Edinburgh, and Paris; at Guy’s Hospital, he was a pupil of Astley Cooper, the greatest English surgeon among the successors of John Hunter. On coming home to America, Warren became his father’s assistant in anatomic research and teaching and in his surgical practice. He was surgeon to the Massachusetts General Hospital from its opening in 1821, was associated with it for thirty-six years, and enjoyed wide recognition as the outstanding American surgeon of the first half of the nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the course of his teaching, he realized the need for an anatomic atlas of the arteries. Accordingly, he had an accomplished medical artist, Josiah Foster Flagg, prepare copies of the artery plates from &lt;i&gt;Icones Anatomicae&lt;/i&gt;, or ‘Images of Anatomy,’ which had been published by the renowned Albrecht von Haller between 1743 and 1756. Haller had improved upon his predecessors’ work by giving accurate representation of actual dissections; these varied, as always in nature, from the ideal which earlier illustrators had tried to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Warren and Flagg did not work directly from the plates in Haller’s book but used an anonymous manual for dissectors issued in London in 1808. This little English edition, with Haller’s plates reduced in size, was published in St. Thomas’s Street, London, and was probably intended for the students of the United School of St. Thomas’s and Guy’s Hospitals, where Warren had studied. Flagg, a dentist and pioneer in the development of porcelain false teeth, was in a class by himself as a medical artist. He engraved the fifteen plates on wood and printed them in two colors to show the arteries in red against the surrounding tissues in black. They were the first anatomic illustrations in color to be printed in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Warren revised the descriptions and added a general account of the arteries. This striking book is very rare; the Lilly Library copy is in its original covers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Warren also published &lt;i&gt;Surgical Observations on Tumors&lt;/i&gt; in 1837, a work famous in its day, but he is now chiefly remembered as the first surgeon to operate on a patient under total anesthesia. This was in 1846, when he was sixty-eight. After his death, the family tradition was continued by his son, grandson, and great-grandson, all of whom were surgeons in Boston” (Waife et al. 169).&lt;/p&gt;","anatomy, regional; atlas; cardiovascular system; musculoskeletal system","Boston, United States","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"A Prospect of Exterminating the Small-Pox . . .","","1800, 1802","&lt;p&gt;“Benjamin Waterhouse (1754-1846) introduced vaccination against smallpox into the United States by demonstrating its effectiveness on his own children and describing the experiment in his pamphlets on extermination of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Waterhouse’s interest in vaccination was aroused in 1798, when an English physician friend wrote to him about cowpox inoculation and then sent him a copy of Edward Jenner’s work on the effects of variola vaccine. Convinced that Jenner’s work was valid, Waterhouse obtained cowpox matter from England in 1800 and vaccinated his five-year-old son. Satisfied with the boy’s response, he vaccinated his other children and servants. A servant boy was then exposed to the disease in a smallpox hospital near Boston and proved to be immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After receiving fresh supplies of cowpox matter from England in the early spring of 1801, Waterhouse continued the vaccinations and then reported on his work in a supplement to his first pamphlet. The supplement, on ‘the progress of the new inoculation in America,’ was much longer than the original publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Among Waterhouse’s other projects was the writing of a popular book in which he warned young people against the evils of tobacco and alcohol. Eight editions of this book were published, including one in French and German. Waterhouse also lectured on natural history, botany, and mineralogy, first at Rhode Island College and then at Harvard University. In 1782, on his return from seven years’ study in England and Europe, he suggested the formation of a humane society and, three years later, helped draw up plans for such an organization in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Waterhouse became the first professor of the theory and practice of physic in Harvard’s newly established department of medicine in 1783. In 1810 he learned of a plan to move the medical school from Cambridge to nearby Boston. So vigorously did he oppose the idea that in 1812 he was forced to resign his professorship, a position he had held for twenty-nine years. The following year, he was appointed medical superintendent of all military posts in New England. While serving in this position, he is believed to have edited (or even written) a romantic narrative, &lt;i&gt;A Journal of a Young Man of Massachusetts&lt;/i&gt; (1816). His last literary work was the editing, at the age of eighty, of John B. Wyeth’s &lt;i&gt;Oregon&lt;/i&gt;, published as a deterrent to western immigration” (Waife et al. 153).&lt;/p&gt;","cowpox; smallpox; smallpox vaccine; vaccinia; vaccinology; viral vaccine","Boston, United States","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Die Arrhythmie als Ausdruck bestimmter Funktionsstörungen des Herzens","","1903","&lt;p&gt;“A native of The Hague, Wenckebach (1864-1940) studied medicine at Utrecht, where his interests focused on embryology and hematology. The discovery that he was color-blind caused him to change his plans. Turning to physiology, he spent long hours in the laboratory studying the fundamental properties of the frog heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When economic circumstances compelled him to leave the university, he entered practice in a small Dutch village. One day, while auscultating a patient, Wenckebach found a strange arrhythmia that reminded him of the irregularity he had frequently observed in his earlier frog experiments. After analyzing sphygmograms recorded from this patient and others, he was able to describe extrasystoles in man for the first time. His discovery of periodic dropped beats, often called ‘Wenckebach’s periods,’ soon followed. The deductive analysis of sphygmograms must be considered a remarkable achievement when one recalls the crude apparatus then in use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Arrhythmia as an Expression of Certain Functional Disturbances of the heart,’ published in German in 1903, was the first comprehensive account of his research. Wenckebach detailed his observations of the physiologic basis of arrhythmias and then discussed their clinical manifestations, noting that various problems of physiology and pharmacology would need to be solved before his findings could be applied clinically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of these problems were being resolved by the time he wrote his later monographs—an expanded one on arrhythmias in 1914 and the monumental ‘The Irregular Action of the Heart’, coauthored with Heinrich Winterberg in 1927.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wenckebach derived much of the inspiration for his research from pupils and patients, and he was candid in acknowledging this fact. His report on the beneficial effect of quinine in certain arrhythmias established the clinical basis for the use of quinidine in cardiac therapeutics. With characteristic honesty, he disclosed that he had first become aware of the effect of quinine on stimulus formation when it was suggested by one of his patients, a Dutch sea captain with auricular fibrillation. The captain had reported that his cardiac irregularity disappeared when he took quinine to prevent malaria. After a pupil aroused Wenckebach’s interest in the circulatory disturbances encountered in beriberi, he traveled to the Dutch East Indies, and his findings there led to a classic contribution to the recognition of nontropical beriberi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the age of thirty-seven, Wenckebach had given up private practice to accept an appointment at the University of Groningen. He subsequently became associated with the University of Strassburg and then the First Medical University Clinic at Vienna, from which he chose to retire at the age of sixty-five. He continued his research, however, until his death eleven years later” (Waife et al. 247).&lt;/p&gt;","anti-arrhythmia agents; arrhythmias, cardiac; arrhythmia, sinus; cardiac complexes, premature","Leipzig, Germany","","","","compound_object","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Die Arrhythmie als Ausdruck bestimmter Funktionsstörungen des Herzens","","1903","&lt;p&gt;“A native of The Hague, Wenckebach (1864-1940) studied medicine at Utrecht, where his interests focused on embryology and hematology. The discovery that he was color-blind caused him to change his plans. Turning to physiology, he spent long hours in the laboratory studying the fundamental properties of the frog heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When economic circumstances compelled him to leave the university, he entered practice in a small Dutch village. One day, while auscultating a patient, Wenckebach found a strange arrhythmia that reminded him of the irregularity he had frequently observed in his earlier frog experiments. After analyzing sphygmograms recorded from this patient and others, he was able to describe extrasystoles in man for the first time. His discovery of periodic dropped beats, often called ‘Wenckebach’s periods,’ soon followed. The deductive analysis of sphygmograms must be considered a remarkable achievement when one recalls the crude apparatus then in use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Arrhythmia as an Expression of Certain Functional Disturbances of the heart,’ published in German in 1903, was the first comprehensive account of his research. Wenckebach detailed his observations of the physiologic basis of arrhythmias and then discussed their clinical manifestations, noting that various problems of physiology and pharmacology would need to be solved before his findings could be applied clinically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of these problems were being resolved by the time he wrote his later monographs—an expanded one on arrhythmias in 1914 and the monumental ‘The Irregular Action of the Heart’, coauthored with Heinrich Winterberg in 1927.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wenckebach derived much of the inspiration for his research from pupils and patients, and he was candid in acknowledging this fact. His report on the beneficial effect of quinine in certain arrhythmias established the clinical basis for the use of quinidine in cardiac therapeutics. With characteristic honesty, he disclosed that he had first become aware of the effect of quinine on stimulus formation when it was suggested by one of his patients, a Dutch sea captain with auricular fibrillation. The captain had reported that his cardiac irregularity disappeared when he took quinine to prevent malaria. After a pupil aroused Wenckebach’s interest in the circulatory disturbances encountered in beriberi, he traveled to the Dutch East Indies, and his findings there led to a classic contribution to the recognition of nontropical beriberi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the age of thirty-seven, Wenckebach had given up private practice to accept an appointment at the University of Groningen. He subsequently became associated with the University of Strassburg and then the First Medical University Clinic at Vienna, from which he chose to retire at the age of sixty-five. He continued his research, however, until his death eleven years later” (Waife et al. 247).&lt;/p&gt;","anti-arrhythmia agents; arrhythmias, cardiac; arrhythmia, sinus; cardiac complexes, premature","Leipzig, Germany","","","","image/jpg","German","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"Cerebri Anatome: cui accessit Nervorum Descriptio et Usus","","1664","&lt;p&gt;“Willis (1621-1675), who was Sedleian professor of natural philosophy at Oxford, wrote the most thorough account of the anatomy of the brain (with a clear classification of the cranial nerves) in that era. With this contribution, he was entitled to be a member of the notable group of seventeenth-century anatomists that included Valsalva, Malpighi, Leeuwenhoek, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In his preface, Willis acknowledged the help of Richard Lower, Thomas Millington, and particularly Christopher Wren, who ‘with the singular kindness for which he is esteemed, made light of drawing many figures of the brain and skull with precise skill and his own highly trained hands.’ Wren’s plates are not signed, but he is credited with the drawing of the base of the human brain that exhibits the ‘circle of Willis.’ Since they show a wealth of detail, the plates are clearer than Willis’ text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book is divided into twenty-nine chapters that are partly anatomic and partly physiologic; it included comparative studies. One chapter, for instance, describes the brains of birds and fish; another, the cerebral arteries ‘in the various animals.’ A plate shows human and equine carotid arteries as well as the rete mirabile and pituitary of the calf. The sequence of chapters covers the posterior parts of the brain, the cerebellum, the cranium, and the dura and meninges; the blood supply; and animal spirits and animal faculties. In the final chapter, the blood supply to the spinal medulla is traced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Willis moved from Oxford to London in 1666 and was successful in medical practice there for nine years before he died at the age of fifty-four. His important contributions to clinical medicine included differential descriptions of epidemic typhoid and puerperal fever and two books on nervous diseases. The &lt;i&gt;Pharmaceutice Rationalis&lt;/i&gt; contained the materia medica of his time. Willis made an exhaustive study of urine and was the first to report that the urine of patients with diabetes mellitus has a sweet taste (distinguishing it from the urine in diabetes insipidus). Typical of his powers of observation is his report of a deaf woman who could hear only when a drum was beating. Her condition was named for him, &lt;i&gt;paracusia Willisii&lt;/i&gt;” (Waife et al. 77).&lt;p&gt;","anatomy, comparative; anatomy, regional; cerebral arteries; carotid arteries; nervous system; nervous system physiological phenomena; neurophysiology; physiology","London, England","","","","image/jpg","Latin","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.

"An Account of the Foxglove, and Some of its Medical Uses: with Practical Remarks on Dropsy, and other Diseases","","1785","&lt;p&gt;“William Withering (1741-1799) discovered the efficacy of digitalis in the treatment of cardiac edema by analyzing a folk remedy and observing that the active ingredient was found in the common foxglove plant (&lt;i&gt;Digitalis purpurea&lt;/i&gt;), which had been used in other herbal remedies for asthma. The drug was known to physicians but had been given indiscriminately; Withering not only pointed out the cases in which it could be prescribed with advantage but also determined the correct dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Withering graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1766. He began his career in the English Midlands, practicing as a physician first in Stafford and then, from 1755 to 1792, in Birmingham. There he was appointed one of the physicians to the General Hospital when it opened in 1779. Three years earlier he had published &lt;i&gt;Botanical Arrangement of All the Vegetables&lt;/i&gt;, a monograph on British flora, which was widely studied; it was arranged according to the new Linnaean system, was often revised, and became a standard reference during the following hundred years. He also wrote an influential study of scarlet-fever epidemics in 1779. After 1784, Withering was attacked by tuberculosis and gradually withdrew from his very successful practice to devote more time to botany and chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When Withering first used digitalis in 1775, he noticed that ‘lives wre hazarded by its unguarded exhibition’ or that, on the other hand, ‘a medicine of efficacy was rejected as dangerous and unmanageable.’ By the time he published his &lt;i&gt;Account&lt;/i&gt;, he had ten years’ experience with the drug and could offer ‘rules and precautions’ for its preparation and administration. The main part of the text, some ninety pages, presents 156 cases from his private practice, followed by reports on eight hospital patients. The next section contains histories of similar cases sent to him by correspondents. The remaining pages contain ‘practical remarks’ on the preparation, dosage, and effects of the medicine, suggest rules and cautions, and, finally, discuss dropsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Withering introduced digitalis as a diuretic in the treatment of dropsy. He recognized that certain individuals responded best to the drug, and his descriptions show that these were cardiac patients. However, it was more than forty years before Richard Bright differentiated cardiac dropsy from renal dropsy. Withering pointed out to colleagues, when they reported failures with the drug, that they were not following his rules but were giving excessive doses in unsuitable cases. His careful analysis made this powerful medicine safe for the treatment of heart diseases” (Waife et al. 139).&lt;/p&gt;","materia medica; medicine, traditional; phytotherapy; therapeutics","Birmingham, England","","","","image/jpg","English","The Lilly Library does not own reproduction rights to the material in its collections, except in certain instances.
